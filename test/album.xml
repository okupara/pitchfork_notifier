&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2128-ice-cube/"&gt;Ice Cube&lt;/a&gt; left N.W.A. in late 1989 over a royalty dispute, a fairly mundane conclusion to his tenure as the intellectual force and chief lyricist for the self-proclaimed “World’s Most Dangerous Group” after only one proper album. Cube’s lyrics for “Fuck the Police” had triggered an F.B.I. response earlier that same year, but Cube was still living at home with his parents when &lt;i&gt;Straight Outta Compton&lt;/i&gt; was rocketing toward platinum status. He was 20 years old, and he’d just turned down a $75,000 check because he didn’t trust &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1428-eazy-e/"&gt;Eazy-E&lt;/a&gt; and Jerry Heller, who ran the group’s label, Ruthless Records. Two years later, with the release of &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt;, he’d be the biggest and most controversial rapper in the world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the two years between Cube’s split in late 1989 and the release of &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt;, his sprawling, imperfect magnum opus in late 1991, rap music grew up in a hurry, experiencing its pop and punk moments simultaneously. Crossover acts like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/10584-ll-cool-j/"&gt;L.L. Cool J&lt;/a&gt;, M.C. Hammer, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27637-vanilla-ice/"&gt;Vanilla Ice&lt;/a&gt;, Kid ‘N Play, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1078-digital-underground/"&gt;Digital Underground&lt;/a&gt; took rap to the top of the charts and into the heart of suburban multiplexes, while southern California gangsta rap continued to proliferate in N.W.A.’s wake via Above the Law, Compton’s Most Wanted and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/877-cypress-hill/"&gt;Cypress Hill&lt;/a&gt;. On the East Coast, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/"&gt;Public Enemy&lt;/a&gt;’s Black Nationalist oratory and incisive media critiques, which inspired &lt;i&gt;Straight Outta Compton, &lt;/i&gt;continued on 1990’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19997-public-enemy-it-takes-a-nation-of-millions-to-hold-us-backfear-of-a-black-planet/"&gt;Fear of a Black Planet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. The Geto Boys took their nightmarish vision of Houston’s Fifth Ward to the Hot 100 singles chart while Miami’s 2 Live Crew emerged as unlikely First Amendment pioneers, and regional rap scenes took shape around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As rap continued to evolve and mutate during this two-year period, forces both internal and external worked to validate it as a cultural and economic power. By 1991, the quickly industrializing genre had spawned its own house organ, as &lt;i&gt;The Source&lt;/i&gt;—the first magazine to cover rap in its fans’ vernacular, and a central node linking the disparate nationwide phenomenon together—was bringing in seven-figure ad revenues after moving to New York City from Boston in 1990. In March 1991, rap was legitimized in a different(and perhaps more significant) way: &lt;i&gt;Billboard &lt;/i&gt;unveiled a radical (and long-overdue) change to its chart methodology. Instead of relying on self-reported sales numbers from retailers—which ignored many independent and “urban” outlets—the new SoundScan system used actual bar code data to determine sales. The impact for rap was felt immediately: N.W.A.’s independently-distributed &lt;i&gt;Efil4zaggin&lt;/i&gt; debuted at #2 on the &lt;i&gt;Billboard &lt;/i&gt;Top 200 chart behind Paula Abdul’s &lt;i&gt;Spellbound, &lt;/i&gt;before climbing to the top spot in its second week. Six months later, &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate, &lt;/i&gt;on which Priority spent $18,000 in marketing and which enjoyed no Top 40 airplay, outsold Hammer’s fourth album &lt;i&gt;Too Legit to Quit&lt;/i&gt; (which Capitol spent a million dollars promoting) in both LPs’ first weeks in stores. Gangsta rap had won. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt; is not Cube’s best album. May 1990’s &lt;i&gt;Amerikkka’s Most Wanted&lt;/i&gt; is tighter, and the peaks of 1992’s &lt;i&gt;The Predator&lt;/i&gt;, released after the Rodney King verdict-inspired L.A. rebellion, are higher. But &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt; is Ice Cube’s most &lt;i&gt;important &lt;/i&gt;album, and one of the most essential works in rap history. Released a few months after Cube’s star turn as the dead-eyed Doughboy in the summer 1991 release &lt;i&gt;Boyz in the Hood,&lt;/i&gt; and preceded by the irresistible first single “Steady Mobbin,” &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt; was anticipated like few rap albums had ever been. It had been six months since the King tape showed the LAPD gang-assaulting a black motorist, and their trial wouldn’t start for another six. A million copies of &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate &lt;/i&gt;were shipped, and it was certified platinum two months after it hit stores. In the shadow of the King video, and with tensions higher than ever between south LA’s black citizens and the police, expectations were high for Cube, who at the time co-owned rap’s creative and political mantle with &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/7233-chuck-d/"&gt;Chuck D&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt;, Cube met them head on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nod toward the vinyl format that was rapidly obsolescing in 1991, Cube split the album into the “Death Side” (“a mirror image of where we are today”) and the “Life Side” (“a vision of where we need to go”). Other rap albums had toyed with the “concept” idea—&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1028-de-la-soul/"&gt;De La Soul&lt;/a&gt;’s 1989 LP &lt;i&gt;3 Feet High and Rising&lt;/i&gt; was a big influence on Cube for &lt;i&gt;AMW&lt;/i&gt;, skits and all. Yet due to its status, &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate &lt;/i&gt;established a permanent lane for conceptual works in rap music, which &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3002-nas/"&gt;Nas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"&gt;Notorious B.I.G&lt;/a&gt;. would capitalize on with their own death-fixated concept albums a few years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt;’s sides serve as an organizing mechanism for Cube’s two primary subject areas. The “Death Side” is Cube as crass hood storyteller, relating oft-hilarious tales about the VD clinic, stopping at your mom’s house to take a shit, haranguing a girl’s dad about her most intimate activities, even a trip to St. Louis that wound up in a jail stay. “Look Who’s Burnin’” and “Steady Mobbin’” show Cube’s unparalleled skill at lighthearted, detail-rich, slice-of-South Central-life songs—they predict not only the melancholic “It Was a Good Day,” but 1995 film &lt;i&gt;Friday&lt;/i&gt;, Cube’s loving, hilarious ode to a single day in his neighborhood. And yes, some of these songs are stomach-churning—“Givin’ Up the Nappy Dugout” wavers between slut-shaming and sexual assault—but the “Death Side” concept is designed to allow Cube a performative “out.” This isn’t autobiography, it argues, but a reflection of the worst impulses of his community (personal mileage, as always, may vary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Life Side,” conversely, is Cube as op-ed columnist, a racially isolationist embodiment of the album’s cover image of Cube standing next to a corpse tagged as “Uncle Sam,” with all the metaphorical subtlety of a political cartoonist. Interracial dating, moving to the suburbs, selling drugs, gangbanging: all of these are noxious activities that are preventing the black race (okay, black &lt;i&gt;men&lt;/i&gt;) from reaching its potential. This side, significantly more controversial than the first, was an outgrowth of Cube’s fortuitous 1990 run-in with Chuck D. in the Def Jam lobby. After splitting with N.W.A. and learning that Ruthless wouldn’t let &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"&gt;Dre&lt;/a&gt; produce his first solo album, Cube headed east, to track down 3rd Bass’ producer. After running into D., Cube took a feature slot on Public Enemy’s 1990 single “Burn Hollywood Burn,” and an east/west creative partnership was established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/10512-the-bomb-squad/"&gt;the Bomb Squad&lt;/a&gt; would exert a huge influence on &lt;i&gt;Amerikkka’s Most Wanted.&lt;/i&gt; “Public Enemy taught me how to put a record together as far as knowing what song should come after what song and the feel of a record,” Cube later recalled. “Chuck D is a master at that. How it’s sequenced as a whole is just as important as each individual record.” &lt;i&gt;AMW&lt;/i&gt; was a huge step forward for West Coast rap, with Cube further shaping the “nigga” and “gangsta” archetypes he’d started with N.W.A. while creating something close to a full conceptual work complete with skits, samples from the actual &lt;i&gt;America’s Most Wanted &lt;/i&gt;television show, and an overall consistency that the shallow-past-the-singles &lt;i&gt;Straight Outta Compton &lt;/i&gt;lacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cube’s other P.E.-inspired transformation was happening at the content level, as he turned N.W.A.’s shock-rap into a new hybrid form: part gangsta nihilism and part post-Black Power militarism, inspired by P.E.’s deep connections with the Nation of Islam and its controversial figurehead Louis Farrakhan. The differences between P.E. and Cube are instructive: if “Fight the Power” pioneered a form of post-Black Power cultural politics informed by a desire for a cultural &lt;i&gt;movement&lt;/i&gt;, then &lt;i&gt;AMW &lt;/i&gt;proper&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;opener “The Nigga You Love To Hate” (and its sequel, &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt; opener ‘The Wrong Nigga to Fuck With”) is driven by Cube’s &lt;i&gt;sui generis &lt;/i&gt;self-interest. Where Chuck D. was an outspoken diplomat, Cube was a righteous mercenary in the KRS-One mold, aiming as much at suburban pieties—hey kids, check out “Gangsta’s Fairytale”!—as his perceived enemies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After eight years under Ronald Reagan’s oppressive social and economic policies, which were particularly devastating to black communities, it made sense for a politicized South Central rapper to shun the idea of community mobilization and carve out a cultural politics of the self. The already privileged succeeded wildly, while historically marginalized populations like those in Compton and South Central L.A. deteriorated. Reagan’s Draconian “war on drugs” devastated inner cities for generations. First Lady Nancy urged kids to “Just Say No,” placing the onus to wipe out the crack epidemic not on the state but the individual. This same bootstraps ideal did away with civil rights organizing in exchange for self-entrepreneurship in a putatively free market, and it was from this landscape that Cube’s new identity was born. Jeff Chang explained it best in &lt;i&gt;Cant Stop, Won’t Stop&lt;/i&gt;: “If &lt;i&gt;Nation of Millions &lt;/i&gt;had signaled the end of the civil rights era, &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt;’s primary impulse was to dance on the grave.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt;, Cube expanded &lt;i&gt;AMW&lt;/i&gt;’s lone-gunman individualism into a fierce, convoluted political manifesto. It’s not just about Cube alone anymore, but the future of young black men. “Niggaz are in a state of emergency” are the first seven words on the album. “I want to see my brothers and sisters on a higher economical level and treating themselves with more respect,” Cube told the &lt;i&gt;L.A. Times &lt;/i&gt;in 1991. “The American Dream is not for&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Blacks. Blacks who (still believe in that dream) are kidding themselves…What I try to do is tell the kids the truth…the brutal, harsh truth—pulling no punches—about what's out there in the world.” Cube’s truth-telling was rooted in his recently forged relationship to the Nation of Islam, a movement that had recenty brought back to prominence by the outspoken Farrakhan. The NOI had done much good for Black communities over time by preaching a gospel of self-reliance and racial separatism. Both notions permeate &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt;’s politics, and, it should be noted, experienced their renaissance during that same individualistic, increasingly identity-factionalized 1980s.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the album’s &lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wBN-caZG-q4/TqyZZk-OwbI/AAAAAAAABrA/6H5Ts2TRs48/s1600/12338_1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;CD tray image&lt;/a&gt;, Cube is pictured reading the NOI newspaper &lt;i&gt;The Final Call&lt;/i&gt;, while strategically positioned between his recently assembled Lench Mob crew on the left and Nation representatives standing at attention on the right. It’s tough to know how much Cube’s NOI affiliation was rooted in ideological purity or performative opportunism—on “Steady Mobbin’”, he wonders if the better come-up is to “start sellin’ bean pies” or bootleg “You Can’t Touch This” t-shirts—though he’d obviously taken Farrakhan’s recommendation to use his fame to spread the word. In 1991, the devout Muslim and Watts-bred rapper Kam and Nation leader Shaheed Muhammad shaved off Cube’s “toxic” Jheri curl, and both appear on the album.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to draw a direct line between NOI teachings (including &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wBAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;amp;lpg=PA16&amp;amp;dq=billboard%20june%2027%2C%201992&amp;amp;pg=PA48-IA7#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;a discredited, Cube-endorsed book&lt;/a&gt; that alleges Jewish people dominated the trans-Atlantic slave trade) and Cube’s anti-Semitic remarks on “No Vaseline,” Cube’s response to N.W.A.’s diss-track diptych “Message to B.A.” and “Real Niggaz” (the latter of which was repurposed from the &lt;i&gt;100 Miles and Runnin’ EP&lt;/i&gt;). “No Vaseline” doesn’t fit with the rest of &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate &lt;/i&gt;at all—it’s like Cube left the stage and confronted N.W.A. in an alley behind the venue, bringing his mic. Although the violence was symbolic, “No Vaseline” remains a hateful song, Cube using homophobia and anti-Semitism as crude weaponry for his macho language battle. The track led the Simon Wiesenthal Center to call for a nationwide boycott of &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate &lt;/i&gt;because Cube recommends dispensing with the “devil” Heller by putting “a bullet in his temple.” Island Records, which distributed the album in Europe, removed “Vaseline” (and “Black Korea”) from copies there. In his review of “Death Certificate,” the &lt;i&gt;Village Voice&lt;/i&gt;’s Robert Christgau called Cube a “sex bigot” and compared “Vaseline” to &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6386-axl-rose/"&gt;Axl Rose&lt;/a&gt;’s xenophobic lyrics on “One in a Million.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Vaseline” controversy fed headlines for months, and for Cube’s millions of fans, its real-life soap-opera thrill only fed into the song’s problematic appeal. Like with so much art that is virtuosic and problematic in equal measure, many took perverse joy listening to Cube eradicate precarious communicative boundaries that help maintain civil discourse. Especially for the teenage boys who comprised Cube’s core audience at the time, “No Vaseline” was its own rap Wrestlemania headline bout: a triumphal act of face-saving in an easy-to-replicate cadence over a sample of Brick’s 1976 disco-funk hit “Dazz.” Cube flipped Ren’s “too much cargo” line from “Real Niggaz” and called him out for driving a B-210, and even turned Eazy-E’s subversive attendance at a Presidential dinner into an act of kowtowing to white authority. Even the song’s title (and theme) was intertextual: It was pulled from LL Cool J’s “To Da Break of Dawn” from the previous year, on which he eviscerates three foes: Kool Moe Dee, MC Hammer, and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/20251-ice-t/"&gt;Ice-T&lt;/a&gt;. Cube outdid L there: he took out &lt;i&gt;five&lt;/i&gt; enemies in one song.  Until Jay-Z’s 2001 Nas-dismantling “Takeover,” “No Vaseline” was rap’s peak diss track: a non-stop series of consecutively landed, clever punchlines. N.W.A. would break up before getting a chance to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No Vaseline”s flawlessly executed “dozens” routine was one thing. The inflammatory 47-second track “Black Korea,” on which Cube rails against—and obliquely threatens—Korean-American shop owners, was another. The community relationship between Korean-American merchants (who had run liquor stores and convenience shops in black parts of Los Angeles for years) was already tense, but it was inflamed by the 1991 shooting of 15-year-old Latasha Harlins by South Central liquor store owner Soon Ja Du, captured on surveillance video only two weeks after the King footage was released. On “Korea,” Cube alternately suggests a boycott (for which there was precedent) and arson for non-compliant storeowners, characterized as “Oriental, one-penny countin’ motherfuckers” and “chop-suey ass.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broader context of this issue is best characterized by Chang: Korean-American storeowners were overworked and often terrorized by local gang members; in 1986, Chang notes, the Black-Korean Alliance was formed after four Korean merchants were killed in a single month. Black citizens, on the other hand, were tired of local merchants who wouldn’t hire black workers, who didn’t give back to local communities, and who assumed that any black-skinned person entering their stores had criminal intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black Korea” was not a nuanced song, but Cube wasn’t a politician or a diplomat. He’s “the nigga you love to hate,” and “the wrong nigga to fuck with.” To many critics, however, &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt; was merely “the rankest sort of racism and hatemongering,” as &lt;i&gt;Billboard&lt;/i&gt; argued in a rare editorial condemning the album. At &lt;i&gt;The Source&lt;/i&gt;, editor James Bernard replied to &lt;i&gt;Billboard &lt;/i&gt;in a manner befitting his publication’s mindset and audience: the industry magazine was “too dainty and thin-skinned to hear the anger and rage and frustration that many people are forced to deal with every day.” This was the official line from Cube’s camp as well. When Christgau asked for comment, Cube’s publicist Leyla Turkkan framed &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt; as “an honest expression of black rage.” Bernard went further (and broader) in a review for &lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;: “I’m not arrogant enough to wag my finger at someone for stridency or incorrect language when many of &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; friends are dead and many of the rest are either in prison or standing on the corner surrounded by burned-out buildings and dying dreams,” he wrote. “These people don’t get to write magazine articles, don’t get elected to political office, and don’t get appointed to the Supreme Court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5023-2pac/"&gt;2Pac&lt;/a&gt; would two years later with &lt;i&gt;Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.&lt;/i&gt;, Cube exploited the mainstream exposure he was receiving as an opportunity to more powerfully broadcast his narrowly intended address. “The truth is I don't care what the white community thinks about the record,” Cube told the &lt;i&gt;LA Times&lt;/i&gt;. “I'm talking directly to my Black brothers and sisters. I speak in a language we talk in the streets. Other people can listen too—they might learn something—but I'm talking to the black kids who need somebody to talk sense—honest sense—to them.” This raises a crucial question that we still deal with today: whites bought &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt;—an album aimed toward black communities—in the millions. How was a white kid in the Midwest suburbs supposed to assume a subject position as the addressee of a song like “Us,” a song that examines the failures of young black men to take ownership of their own futures, and not rely on government intervention? The answer: we couldn’t. Instead, we eavesdropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one of the most profound cultural shifts occasioned by the rise of gangsta rap, and pioneered by Ice Cube on &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt;, is the phenomenon of mass-cultural “listening in.” An album that sells millions of copies is designed to function as a communicative channel from one young black man to an audience of other black men. Chang called &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate &lt;/i&gt;“the most impassioned attempt to speak to the young guns of South Central since Bunchy Carter had left the Slausons for the Panthers.” On one hand, of course, this perspective permits Cube a tautological “out”—“I’m not talking to you so you’re not my audience”—that is logically disproven by the fact that he’s releasing the album to a mass audience. On the other hand, understanding the intended audience of a work is absolutely crucial to empathizing with its message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there were messages: Amid Cube’s fiercest isolationist tendencies, &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate &lt;/i&gt;exposes structural failings in a way that no rapper had yet attempted with this degree of clarity. Non-Black listeners may have bought the album for the illicit thrills of “Steady Mobbin’,” “Look Who’s Burnin’” or “No Vaseline,” but those with open ears could learn &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt; from “Alive on Arrival.” Dramatically concluding the album’s “Life” side, penultimate track “Arrival” is a grim, detail-rich narrative of a drug-related shooting victim (“looked down, and my sweatshirt’s red at the bottom”) who dies while waiting for treatment at South Central’s MLK Community Hospital after being harassed by the LAPD. Cube’s description of his waiting room horror makes for one of the album’s most richly ironic lines: “One hour done passed/Done watched two episodes of M*A*S*H*”. Much of the public attention paid to &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate &lt;/i&gt;was devoted to Cube’s lashing out at anyone who stands in his way, but on “Arrival,” he talks about “an overworked physician” who didn’t have the time to give his character more than a band-aid and IV. “Why, oh why, can’t I get help?” Cube pleads as the song concludes. “’Cause I’m Black, I gots to go for self.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s “A Bird in the Hand,” Cube’s single greatest solo work (with respect to “Who’s the Mack,” “Dead Homiez” and “It Was a Good Day”), and one of the signal moments not only for gangsta rap, but rap history. For just over two minutes, Cube perfectly combines the hardhead, oft-comical street narratives of the Death Side with the fiercely opinionated Life Side tracks. As rhetoric, it’s powerful: the day-to-day life of a young black man in Bush Sr.’s America was pinned in on all sides, with no logical action for economic survival, let alone success, that didn’t involve drug dealing. The trade-offs are expressed with sharp detail—“Always knew that I would clock G’s/But ‘Welcome to McDonalds, may I take your order please?”—and pragmatism: “So now you got a pep talk/But sorry, this is our only room to walk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is saying nothing about the track itself, which is magisterial: Cube’s production crew the Boogiemen (DJ Pooh, Bobcat, and Rashad) interrupt the album’s &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6208-george-clinton/"&gt;George Clinton&lt;/a&gt; fixation to flip Jimmue Haskell’s paranormal string break from the final third of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2301-bb-king/"&gt;B.B. King&lt;/a&gt;’s 1970 slave-trade opus “Chains and Things” over a razor-sliced drum knock from the first seconds of the Five Stairsteps’ “Don’t Change Your Love.” &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"&gt;Kendrick Lamar&lt;/a&gt;’s 2012 flip of those drums and Cube’s “fresh outta school” opening line in the MC Eiht-featuring “m.A.A.d City”—a work deeply inspired by Cube’s early ’90s albums—made for a spine-tingling moment of cross-generational gangsta-rap continuity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamar himself inducted Cube and the rest of N.W.A. into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2016, largely because of the Cube-penned “Fuck the Police” and “Straight Outta Compton.” That’s just one metric of his reputation, however. To many 2016 teenagers—the age group who loves Lamar and would’ve bought &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt; in 1991—N.W.A. is classic rap, canonized in a 2015 biopic, Cube’s solo career is most likely boiled down to “It Was a Good Day,” and he’s more widely known as the star of &lt;i&gt;Friday&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Barbershop&lt;/i&gt; movies, if not the angry Captain Dickson in &lt;i&gt;21 Jump Street&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/720-who-got-the-camera-nwas-embrace-of-reality-1988-1992/"&gt;The proto-reality “true-crime” moment of the late 80s and early 90s&lt;/a&gt; that spawned Cube’s approach toward rap storytelling has itself morphed into a celebreality TV entertainment juggernaut (see: &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"&gt;Kanye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"&gt;Drake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1840-the-game/"&gt;the Game&lt;/a&gt;), while smartphone footage of police killing Black citizens has become a macabre reality of daily online life, mortifying millions but spurring little actual change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polls show that the country is more racially divided than at any time since the Rodney King verdict, six months after Ice Cube tossed &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate &lt;/i&gt;like a Molotov cocktail into the nation’s heated debate about race and rights. In 2016, the death rate for black Americans, according to the CDC, is roughly 50% higher than for whites. Much about American culture—who may speak publicly, who may be defended—has changed for the better since late 1991, rendering much of &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt;’s sexism, homophobia, racism and anti-Semitism antiquated. At the same time, however, the rest of the album—a Black artist forcefully arguing for Black unity and freedom in the face of looming, state-sanctioned mortality—remains as sadly as relevant as ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through most of &lt;i&gt;What’s Your Sign?, &lt;/i&gt;the new album by veteran maximalist composer &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/730-rhys-chatham/"&gt;Rhys Chatham&lt;/a&gt; and Brooklyn DIY drone-blasters &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3157-oneida/"&gt;Oneida&lt;/a&gt;, Chatham takes only minimal steps into the spotlight. Perhaps inverting the usual super-session logic, Chatham’s guitar and trumpet blend convincingly into Oneida’s 15-year-running noisenik dynamic, while the quintet channel the power of Chatham’s work. The 35-minute LP never achieves the epic scale that both can work at—Chatham with his armies of up to 400 guitarists, Oneida via their rigorous eight-hour-straight Ocropolis performances—but each of the six tracks generates a be-here-now flash of present-tense psychedelia, hallucinations by way of overtones and volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing a monumental centerpiece, &lt;i&gt;What's Your Sign?&lt;/i&gt; comes closest with the nine-minute “Well Tuned Guitar,” its title referencing the microtonal work of Chatham’s one-time teacher, the psychedelic minimalist &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/15831-la-monte-young/"&gt;La Monte Young&lt;/a&gt;. Building towards slashing chords—and Chatham’s big spotlight—the drama draws from the rhythmic language Chatham has been refining since 1977’s “Guitar Trio,” written after seeing the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3524-ramones/"&gt;Ramones&lt;/a&gt; at CBGB. It’s perhaps the only place the pairing doesn’t completely click. In the hands of Oneida, while still sounding convincingly enormous, the approach also feels slightly contained, as if following a map instead of the terrain itself. Oneida’s semi-formalist mind-exploding can be heard more vividly on the disc-opening “You Get Brighter,” an exercise in forward motion driven by drummer &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/17456-kid-millions/"&gt;Kid Millions&lt;/a&gt;, a propulsion that seems as if it could keep expanding outwards forever. Chatham’s guitar bends and freaks with the rest of the Oneida brahs, his voice adding to the song’s one-line refrain, both a signpost and conductor’s baton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oneida sometimes function more like a liquid light show than a traditional rock band. They most often concern themselves with a swirl of repetition, the type of music where—watching live—it’s not always possible to tell who is making what sound, perhaps not even for those playing in the band, either. Chatham and Oneida’s music feels most natural in these places, using the change of texture as a form of a movement. On a pair of drumless jams, “Bad Brains” and “The Mabinogian,” the music never stops pressing into the unknown, the driving pulse only heard in the negative space between oscillations. The music itself could be coming from any combination of the three guitarists and two keyboardists, a free improv counterpoint to the full-throttle rhythmic spectacles heard elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balance of &lt;i&gt;What's Your Sign?&lt;/i&gt; makes it feel like an Oneida album, built on power and cosmic eruptions. Besides the &lt;i&gt;Positions&lt;/i&gt; EP (featuring a driving cover of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4216-this-heat/"&gt;This Heat&lt;/a&gt;'s “S.P.Q.R.”), it’s the band’s first proper release in four years. In the interim, they’ve transformed even more fully into a live act; in 2013, &lt;a href="http://www.nyctaper.com/2013/10/oneida-october-4-2013-glasslands-flacmp3streaming-full-set/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;a 48-minute set-opening incarnation&lt;/a&gt; of “You Get Brighter” &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; almost expand outwards forever. Besides the touch of Chatham’s compositional hand on “Well Tuned Guitar,” &lt;i&gt;What's Your Sign? &lt;/i&gt;is another sliver of Oneida’s ever-jamming life, a place both unpredictable and consistent, where collaborators like Chatham might arrive and make themselves at home. Even tracks that start out sounding nothing like Oneida fall easily into the band’s gravity well. On “A. Phillip Randolph at Back Bay Station,” after Chatham strikes a gentle keynote with layered flute, the band quickly lifts into a group glide over a rolling snare drum sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chatham’s trumpet loops finally break through and take over the four minutes of the album-closing “Civil Weather.” It’s a mode that one wouldn’t expect to find Oneida exploring, more &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27976-jon-hassel/"&gt;Jon Hassell&lt;/a&gt;-like &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19984-brian-eno-jon-hassel-fourth-world-vol-1-possible-musics/"&gt;Fourth World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; bliss than kosmiche fire music, a trumpet clearing a central path down the middle of Oneida space. But in plenty of other ways—sure, why not? It’s a new place they find together, the kind of spot they might get to for a few minutes one night when the tapers didn’t make it out, and then never try again. With more than one &lt;i&gt;What’s Your Sign?&lt;/i&gt; track fading to delighted in-studio laughter, it’s only a surprise when it ends so soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Like a lot of minimalist art, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/34036-sarah-davanchi/"&gt;Sarah Davachi&lt;/a&gt;’s music appears simple on the surface. Not a lot seems to happen, at least not in terms of melody, rhythm, or any of the usual categories of Western popular music: Her music consists mainly of long held tones. The real action is not found in the notes themselves but in their microtonal variations and the wealth of overtones, harmonics, and ghostly pulses produced by the friction between them. Her work belongs to a tradition of deep, shimmering drone music that includes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28422-eliane-radigue/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Eliane Radigue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1157-kevin-drumm/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Kevin Drumm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3038-phill-niblock/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Phill Niblock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5844-lamonte-young/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;La Monte Young&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/20423-marian-zazeela/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Marian Zazeela&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/24036-folke-rabe/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Folke Rabe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its apparent restraint, Davachi’s music is also profoundly expressive. Her filters sweep back and forth in slow, deliberate, and often unpredictable movements that suggest the careful thought process that drives the hand behind them. The subtlest change can set in motion complicated chain reactions—ebbing and flowing, wheels turning within wheels. Play her music in a quiet room on good speakers and you can practically see the air moving around your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In part, this has to do with her tools. Davachi, who studied electronic music at Mills College, in Oakland, California, typically works with a mixture of acoustic and electronic sources, or even purely acoustic instruments. Her album &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;All My Circles Run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, from earlier this year, is a set of studies for overdubbed strings, voice, organ, and piano. On &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Vergers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, she turns her attention to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMS_Synthi_100" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;EMS Synthi 100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, an analog synthesizer from the early 1970s, and complements its unusually vibrant tone with almost imperceptible additions of voice and violin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is her most minimal album yet. Its three long tracks initially feel almost static; they evolve so stealthily that it's easy to find yourself adrift in the middle, wondering just how you got there. The opening “Gentle So Gentle,” nearly 22 minutes long, begins with a single octave, its tones wavering like heat mirages. A minute passes; then two. It takes a while to notice a pair of quiet background tones, glowing like street lights in fog. In time, it will come to feel like all seven notes of a minor scale are resonating in blurry unison. Timbres shift; tones fatten. For a spell, the sound resembles a piano whose sustain pedal has been held down. Then, a pair of clarinets. Fifteen minutes in, and the atmosphere turns celestial for its final passage. The piece begins on a different note than the one with which it began, and even though you probably won't notice it, that shift lends an extra element of tension. There is no resolution; it is a question with no answer, an imperative to keep moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where “Gentle So Gentle” is shot through with light, “Ghosts and All” is charged with dread. Over buzzing pedal tones, thin, violin-like textures saw queasily back and forth, like a camera panning across a burned forest. It is as bleak as the grimmest doom metal. Once again, she proves herself a master manipulator of frequency, stacking up layers until even the root note is lost in the miasma, and you're left disoriented, unable to find your footing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and final track, “In Staying,” uses similar strategies, but it's immediately distinguishable from its companions. (Proof that Davachi is not your average drone artist is her facility for evoking wildly different universes with such a modest set of tools.) The sound evokes church bells that have been frozen in mid-peal. New tones bleed into earshot, and the bells melt away. Now we are inside a glacier, perhaps; the time scale is unfathomably long. Inside the sound, made one with the all-encompassing hum, a million tiny vibrations collide. If timbre is one of Davachi’s primary materials, time is another—thus her all-enveloping matrix of infinite ripple—and with “In Staying,” she manages a feat that is nearly impossible in music: She makes time itself seem to stand stock still.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pianist &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/34091-vicky-chow/"&gt;Vicky Chow&lt;/a&gt; has been building a discography focused on modern classical sounds ever since completing her studies at Juilliard and the Manhattan School of Music. &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/works-for-piano/id429933577" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;She appeared&lt;/a&gt; on a release from &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4725-john-zorn/"&gt;John Zorn&lt;/a&gt;’s Tzadik imprint, and &lt;a href="http://www.vickychow.com/cage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;interpreted the music of John Cage&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, she made a star turn on a &lt;a href="http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/radio-rewrite" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Steve Reich album&lt;/a&gt;. Though Chow is obviously a virtuoso when it comes to acoustic work, she has also shown an interest in pieces that employ electronics. &lt;a href="http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/radio-rewrite" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Her premiere&lt;/a&gt; of Reich’s “Piano Counterpoint” required her to play against pre-recorded parts; Chow’s recording of composer &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29204-tristan-perich/"&gt;Tristan Perich&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://vickychow.bandcamp.com/album/tristan-perich-surface-image" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Surface Image&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found the pianist threading notes in between 40 channels of chirping, 1-bit sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to that resume, it’s hardly a shock to discover that Chow’s first solo album for the New Amsterdam label involves electro-acoustic setups. &lt;i&gt;A O R T A&lt;/i&gt; features pieces from six up-and-coming composers, each of whom pushes the limits of the instrument in some way. Christopher Cerrone’s “Hoyt-Schermerhorn” has an icy profile, at first, as softly played progressions creep slowly into the piano’s highest reaches. But when a rising figure in a low octave is introduced, Chow’s playing communicates the effusive release embedded in those notes (even as the overall harmony remains melancholic). Increasingly dense layers of sound then clue a listener in to the fact that some of this playing is not being done live. But even when Cerrone’s digital design asserts itself more clearly—via glitchy, refracted notes—the center of the piece holds.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another winner is Molly Joyce’s “Rave.” The work starts out sounding anything but exultant, sporting motifs that seem emotionally mismatched. (In &lt;a href="http://mollyjoycemusic.com/works/solo/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;the score&lt;/a&gt;, Joyce’s description of a tempo as “controlled but on the edge” seems appropriate.) As the composition develops, Joyce’s lines achieve an odd syncopation, and ultimately a sense of balance strong enough to suggest a club-influenced feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a potent sense of physicality in Chow’s performance of that piece—one which also carries over to Andy Akiho’s “Vick(i/y).” Written for Chow and fellow pianist Vicki Ray, Akiho’s prepared-piano opus stretches the range of the instrument by calling for the direct strumming of strings inside the piano’s body. That technique isn’t a new one. But Akiho’s use of it here serves percussive and melodic ends that prove structurally satisfying, when traditional-sounding lines sprout and shoot away from the modernist opening material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the hour-long program isn’t quite on the same level as those compositions, though the pieces are all worth hearing. Jacob Cooper’s “Clifton Gates” is a clever homage to John Adams’s famous minimalist composition “Phrygian Gates.” Jakub Ciupinksi’s four-movement “Morning Tale” has moments of dramatic propulsion. Two movements from &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31471-daniel-wohl/"&gt;Daniel Wohl&lt;/a&gt;’s “Aorta” contain the composer’s typical blend of jabbing aggression and dreamy fluidity. Though without a full performance of the work, its impression is necessarily muted. Chow handles these composers’ various electronic setups with grace, never letting the tech overwhelm the particular aesthetic. Arrangement eccentricities aside, the most notable quality of &lt;i&gt;A O R T A&lt;/i&gt; is the pianist’s deep, evident investment in these consistently rewarding pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;At first blush, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Redemption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, the new &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30349-dawn-richard/"&gt;Dawn Richard&lt;/a&gt; record, feels like a victory lap. The conclusion to a trilogy of albums, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Redemption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; signifies the end of a project that felt, at one point, as if its completion were uncertain, between shifting collaborators and Richard's brief 2014 reunion with the girl group Danity Kane. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Redemption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;'s opening tracks also seem to confirm that it's intended as the inverse to its predecessor, 2015's &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20104-blackheart/"&gt;Blackheart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, the sound of which was thick and full of dissonance; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Redemption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; initially feels weightless. As it progresses, though, it reveals a depth that's both distinct from its predecessors and draws on them both. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Richard's 2013 album, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17619-goldenheart/"&gt;Goldenheart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, seemed to describe a disintegrating relationship that had ascended into myth; Richard positioned herself as if she were engaged in battle with her own emotions, and through metaphor her emotions had swollen into literal giants. “Faced the beast with my bare hands/Tried to break me down with all his strength,” she sang in “Goliath.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Blackheart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; was more slippery, a vortex of introspection in which Richard’s grasp of metaphor seemed to deliberately loosen, so that mythical figures like Calypso and the Titans coexisted with the thrum of amphetamines and the slur of depression.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;If &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Goldenheart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is aggressive and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Blackheart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is depressive, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Redemption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is reflective. This is a curious position from which to record a dance record; the dance floor is rarely characterized as a reflective space. More often it is utopian, escapist, a portal to an alternate reality. In the first proper song, “Love Under Lights,” Richard paints her own dance floor vision. She encounters a woman in a Led Zeppelin shirt, and they start to talk about music. “She said she fucking with Drake/I said King Kendrick,” Richard sings as the synthetic pulses behind her ripple and gleam. “I guess we’re kindred spirits.” Richard conceives of the dance floor as a place of protest (“Black Crimes”), of contemplation (“Voices”), of engagement (“Vines”), all of which are components of desire, whether for another person or another life. The drums behind her shatter and reorganize themselves into new rhythms throughout the album , as if they’re building and disassembling digital chandeliers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The production on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Redemption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is distinct from the glassy backdrops her former collaborator and manager Druski provided on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Goldenheart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and it's a deliberate move away from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Blackheart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;'s production, which felt like being sucked into a whirlpool. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Blackheart’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;s primary producer, Noisecastle III, appears twice on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Redemption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, on “Black Crimes” and “LA,” but his more collagist aesthetic blends seamlessly with the sound world that &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2630-machine-drum/"&gt;Machinedrum&lt;/a&gt; and Richard build, an incandescent fusion of the organic and the synthetic, the electronic and the acoustic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes that open “Voices,” while digitally manipulated and multiplied, sound like they've been issued from a bass clarinet. The bass tones that break through the surface of “Renegades” are oddly reminiscent of a tuba. “LA” is a parallel ode to Louisiana, where Richard was born, and Los Angeles, where Richard lives now; it mutates from a stuttered, ultramodern gleam &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;into a spiraling guitar solo that sounds imported from a ’70s jazz fusion album. Then the melody shifts again, this time performed by a polyphonic brass band arranged by Trombone Shorty to resemble a New Orleans second line parade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The integrity of Richard's voice provides the through line, which is often caught in ghostly tangles of itself or locking into prismatic harmonies, similar to how &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/7624-dangelo/"&gt;D’Angelo&lt;/a&gt; treated their voices. On the interludes, which are often as fully formed as the actual songs, Richard isolates and distorts her voice until it seems to separate into kilobytes. “Hey Nikki” is the closest the album comes to settling into an R&amp;amp;B tradition: It's an inversion of Prince’s “Darling Nikki,” considering the character through a different lens; instead of viewing her as an object of desire, it isolates her agency, and the song generates its desire from the aura of that agency. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Blackheart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; did the same thing with the titular character of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt;’s “Billie Jean.”&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Richard’s voice floats above the music in the verses, but  doubles, deepens, and fights through a menacing haze in the chorus: “Hey Nikki/Don't you wanna come and get with me?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;After “Hey Nikki” the album descends into a more introspective space. “Sands” describes a past relationship; In “The Louvre” she elevates someone into “a work of art” as a way of letting them go, and then the record itself lets go of its own instrumentation as it segues the outro, “Valhalla.” Richard, her voice heavily processed, finally glimpses her utopia; it is one “where rebels are the majority/And my color isn't a minority.” The tone is one of arrival after a long struggle, but there are hints, too, that this maybe a fantasy: “Escape,” she sings, and it feels as if her promised land was a mirage, forever shimmering just out of reach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know the feeling of being jolted awake at &lt;span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1280749357"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;3 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by every outstanding obligation in your life, you'll recognize the paralyzing anxiety embedded in the lyrics of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/34084-jeff-rosenstock/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=http://pitchfork.com/artists/34084-jeff-rosenstock/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1479948446901000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHOEAGm0HMv4xie0H3b1F3rV1ZTRQ"&gt;Jeff Rosenstock&lt;/a&gt;’s third solo LP. To wit: “Ignorance is bliss until the day/The things you ignored all come into focus.” When those things emerge, they will waylay you with the same nagging, needling and relentless tone that knows every single pressure point in your system. Rosenstock has &lt;i&gt;always &lt;/i&gt;sung like this, so &lt;i&gt;WORRY. &lt;/i&gt;isn’t a case of an artist finding his voice. Rather, it’s an artist finding his muse—it's right there in the title—and making the record of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Rosenstock didn’t really need a magnum opus to solidify his reputation as one of the most important figures in modern punk music—in certain circles, he’s basically an &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6217-ian-mackaye/"&gt;Ian MacKaye&lt;/a&gt; figure, a paragon of ethics whose web-based, pay-what-you-want record label gave him legitimate reason to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/jeff-rosenstock-bombed-music-industry-though-it-to-242209" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;feel salty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; when &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"&gt;Nine Inch Nails&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"&gt;Radiohead&lt;/a&gt; were called revolutionaries for doing the same thing years later. However, he was doing this as the leader of a ska-punk project called the Arrogant Sons of Bitches and, later, Bomb the Music Industry! As the names of these acts might imply, this stuff wasn’t bound for mainstream acceptance, though Rosenstock’s sonic and philosophical influence has been acknowledged by verbose and principled young acts like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32348-joyce-manor/"&gt;Joyce Manor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31933-modern-baseball/"&gt;Modern Baseball&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mitskileaks/status/785235258593730560" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Mitski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;WORRY. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;isn’t an obvious crossover attempt. Rosenstock touches on almost every intersection of pop and punk, whether or not it’s credible: there are flashes of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2172-jawbreaker/"&gt;Jawbreaker’&lt;/a&gt;s real-talk scene reportage, the synth-spiked sugar rushes of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/100-the-anniversary/"&gt;the Anniversary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1706-the-get-up-kids/"&gt;the Get Up Kids&lt;/a&gt;, but also previously canonical touchstones that have become relegated to Boomerism nostalgia: &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"&gt;the Beach Boys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/771-the-clash/"&gt;the Clash&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13431-abbey-road/"&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; After the beer-hoisting nostalgia of “Blast Damage Days,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;WORRY. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;unexpectedly (and hilariously) hits double time and tries to cram Rosenstock’s entire discography into a Side B medley, breathlessly running through &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4345-twista/"&gt;Twista&lt;/a&gt;-paced spitfire punk, 30-second blasts of D-beat hardcore and an unashamedly infectious ska song.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;WORRY. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is rife with similarly invigorating and wildly unfashionable touches—the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3553-reggie-and-the-full-effect/"&gt;Reggie and the Full Effect&lt;/a&gt;-style electropop intro of “Festival Song,” his voice cracking on the line, “So we made out &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;foooooor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; the entire ride” like drunken &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5558-rivers-cuomo/"&gt;Rivers Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; karaoke. “I wanna listen to the Cribs my dear, while we make out in your car,” he sings on “Pash Rash.” Among other things, Rosenstock is mounting a rousing defense of genre—“Stop sneering at our joy like it’s some careless mistake,” he snarls on “We Begged 2 Explode,” where a swaying piano ballad erupts into a kitchen-drinking singalong at a house party. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Punk usually has to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;sound &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;serious to be taken seriously, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;WORRY. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is stuffed with so with many sugarcoated melodies it’s almost headache-inducing. Yet there isn’t a single insubstantial lyric here:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;it’s a record about New York gentrification, the internet, police brutality, liberal guilt, DIY idealism—crucial subject matter that typically inspire chin-stroking appreciation or eye-rolls because of their self-serious delivery. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Instead, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;WORRY. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is an absolute blast and its heaviest stories are presented as some of the most devastating breakup songs of the past year. “Staring Out the Window at Your Old Apartment” plays on the “Is She Really Going Out With Him?” trope: “Someone hung a decorative surfboard up where your records and movies belong,” Rosenstock yells, but they still can’t hide the cracks in the wall that the landlord was never going to fix and the tacky renovations that followed. “You’ve got nowhere to go now,” he moans, in a lyric that exhibits scorn-free empathy for New Yorkers and the shitholes they’ve somehow been been priced out of. Rosenstock fondly reminisces over drinking tallboys by the water on “Wave Goodnight to Me,” written in memory of shuttered Death By Audio (and accompanied by a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7MPzv78cWs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;dead-on video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;). “I wish it didn’t hurt. I wish I didn’t care,” he brays, knowing that all DIY spaces are living on borrowed time and this one would eventually become the new &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Vice &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;office: “They spent the last five years, yelling, ‘Come on! Come on! Come on! Get out of here!’”  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Much of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;WORRY. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is put in this “us vs. them” battleground, but Rosenstock isn’t a scold—he realizes you might not figure out you’re &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;them &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;until it’s too late. “Festival Song” takes easy licks at  “dorm room” music, “sweatshop denim jackets,” “department store crust punk chic,” and, well, you name it: “They wouldn’t be your friend if it wasn’t worth it/If you didn’t have something they could take.” His ire isn’t just limited to AEG and Live Nation pumping more hot air &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stereogum.com/1890534/countdown-to-extinction-an-update-from-the-front-lines-of-the-festival-wars/franchises/but-whos-buying/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;into a bubble that already burst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, or Funyuns sponsoring whatever the hell &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spin.com/2016/10/meet-mayer-hawthorne-shakey-graves-and-more-at-the-funyuns-exhaleorometer-at-voodoo-experience/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;WORRY. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;was fittingly released right in the middle of October; it began with the NFL “going pink” as a meek gesture towards women jersey-buyers while treating domestic violence cases with less gravity than touchdown celebrations, and ended with Twitter shuttering Vine, a seemingly utopian mode of expression that in reality &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thefader.com/2015/12/03/on-fleek-peaches-monroee-meechie-viral-vines" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;repeatedly exploited people of color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; (and still didn’t make a dime). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As much as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;WORRY. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;deals in financial insecurity—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;#1 worry of all—it speaks to the unshakable notion that American society is one giant game of big-bank-take-little-bank and we’re all “born as a data mine for targeted marketing,” discarded when we’re no longer in a demographic worth exploiting. Needless to say, it's become even &lt;i&gt;more &lt;/i&gt;resonant in the past month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;If this all sounds exhausting, well—would &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;WORRY. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;live up to its name if it &lt;i&gt;wasn’t&lt;/i&gt;? But there’s something reassuring about worry, how it is inextricable from daily existence, how it can reveal what’s actually meaningful when total nihilism is always a tempting option. Dropped in the middle of Rosenstock’s surveys of urban cultural decline, “I Did Something Weird Last Night” turns out to be the neurotic punk’s answer to “It Was a Good Day”—“I made out in the van with a girl I like/We were kinda drunk but it seemed alright,” Rosenstock yelps, explaining the title and returning to his apartment, sleeping through classes the next day and wondering when he’ll ever see her again. It’s a beautifully written song about the brief moments when irrational, giddy emotion can shout down the Voice of Worry and allow good things to happen despite everything—and also about the way people can talk themselves out of good things immediately afterwards once worry returns: “if I see you soon, will you want to see me?”; “I hope I’m not reading into this too much, it’s a kiss.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Rosenstock wrote “I Did Something Weird Last Night” about his girlfriend at the time, who is now his wife; the album’s cover art is taken from their wedding photos. But at the time, he admits, “I was preoccupied with how the magic would end/Because nothing intangible remains sustainable/Hope is a scheme.” It ties into the worry that pervades every interaction on this record, whether it’s with peers, corporations, political causes, anything—if you actually &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;give a shit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, have expectations and get your hopes up, you’re going to get played for a sucker. But later on, he shouts &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;WORRY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;’s most cathartic and reassuring line and like most others, if you’re not paying attention, you might miss what this album is really about: “Love is worry.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“If any of y’all wanna give me shit about my twang, you can just do it,” &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4572-gillian-welch/"&gt;Gillian Welch&lt;/a&gt; once told a chatty San Francisco crowd in 1994. It was two years before Welch would release her debut &lt;i&gt;Revival&lt;/i&gt;, but the California-bred daughter of two entertainers was already anticipating the skepticism that would greet her when she rose to prominence in the mid-to-late ’90s singing about destitute coal miners and Depression-era whiskey runners with an unsettling familiarity for someone born in New York City, raised in Los Angeles, and who found their lifetime musical partner at a conservatory in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 1994, Welch’s repertoire consisted largely of a number of songs that would never find their way onto a record, a handful of traditional tunes, and some &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28787-john-prine/"&gt;John Prine&lt;/a&gt; covers. For an artist with an aesthetic as carefully and consistently rendered as Gillian Welch, it’s strange to think of a time when she wasn’t producing or reproducing that aesthetic, but was, rather, searching for it herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That sense of fresh discovery and wide-eyed experimentation can be heard plainly on&lt;i&gt; Boots No. 1,&lt;/i&gt; Welch’s first archival release that serves as a 20th anniversary expanded release for her debut LP.  The two-disc collection is comprised of outtakes, demos, and alternate takes culled from the &lt;i&gt;Revival&lt;/i&gt; sessions, a time when Welch and guitarist Dave Rawlings were first honing in on their precise sound, mood, and style. “There really was no me. The artist Gillian Welch didn’t really exist,” Welch has said of the sessions, “And then after that, I did.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Welch’s spectral country music has always felt otherworldly in its ability to evoke feelings, memories and atmosphere on command. “Sound [that] holds moods the way humid air holds smells,” is how writer Jedediah Purdy has described it. Part of the revelation of &lt;i&gt;Boots No. 1,&lt;/i&gt; then, is witnessing Welch’s music made mortal, to hear her navigating her many influences with a young artist’s enlightened uncertainty, and to hear imperfect recordings that may not necessarily conjure universes on their own accord so much as they recall old-fashioned country music that’d sound at home on the radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Some of the most thrilling moments on this 21-song release are just that: hit records. “455 Rocket” is a hand-clapping muscle car ode in which Welch deadpans goofy lines likes like, “Whose junk pile piece of sh….Chevelle is this?” “Dry Town” is a talking country-blues &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/"&gt;Johnny Cash&lt;/a&gt; pastiche about craving a six-pack for the road. The former became a hit for country singer Kathy Mattea in 1997, while the latter ended up, a decade later, on &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/8649-miranda-lambert/"&gt;Miranda Lambert&lt;/a&gt;’s chart-topping &lt;i&gt;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Boots No. 1&lt;/i&gt; takes a more subtle approach than landmark archival releases like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"&gt;Dylan&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;i&gt;Bootleg Series&lt;/i&gt;. With dozens of songs remaining unreleased from this period, many of which, like “Birds of a Feather” and “Unfinished Business,” are even more telling examples of the diverse country traditions Welch was soaking up at the time, this collection is definitively more interested in tracing &lt;i&gt;Revival&lt;/i&gt;’s process and evolution than in presenting any sort of radically alternate history of Welch’s mid-90’s artistry.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Nevertheless, witnessing gradual transformation can be revelatory, and several early takes lay bare the process of refining Gillian Welch into “Gillian Welch” with staggering clarity. The version of “Paper Wings” that made its way to the final album is much slower, sparser, and jazz-leaning than the honky-tonk demo. Moments like this show how greatly producer &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/16802-t-bone-burnett/"&gt;T Bone Burnett&lt;/a&gt;’s subtle aesthetics helped sculpt Welch’s sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Listening to the original &lt;i&gt;Revival&lt;/i&gt; now, it’s astounding to hear all the constructed artifices and delicate contemporary flourishes that were so easy to overlook when the album first came out. The closing moments of “Orphan Girl,” Welch’s first signature tune, reveal a shocking swirl of grungy guitar feedback and tape distortion. “One More Dollar” is just one of several songs with a crisp, full rhythm section, a reminder that Welch and Rawlings wouldn’t settle into their now-famous acoustic duo format until 1998’s follow up &lt;i&gt;Hell Among the Yearlings&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As several of these new songs also affirm, Welch’s third-person storylines often point inwards at moving autobiography. Like so much of &lt;i&gt;Revival&lt;/i&gt;, “Wichita” and “Riverboat Song” are stories of movement and motion that trace both the thrill of fleeing home and the lonely alienation of being a stranger in the big city. Both songs were written just a year after Welch and Rawlings had moved to Nashville, a period when the two singers lived a ghostly existence spent largely recording music in the middle of the night by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Part of Welch and Rawlings’ aura is the sense that their music exists out of time, so it’s illuminating to hear the two artists conversing so intimately with contemporary genres and artists. They cover Robert Earl Keen and later, respond to him in song with “I Don’t Want to Go Downtown.” Lyrically, “Barroom Girls” is an equal-rights-to-party anthem that would’ve sounded at home on a Lilith Fair mainstage. On the other hand, “Pass You by” is strikingly loud, just a full drum-kit away from sounding like an outtake on &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"&gt;Wilco&lt;/a&gt;’s roots-grunge opus &lt;i&gt;Being There&lt;/i&gt;, released six months after &lt;i&gt;Revival&lt;/i&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;All of which goes to show that the authenticity scare that surrounded Welch upon her arrival feels, &lt;span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_208936868"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;twenty years later&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, almost unrecognizably dated. Perhaps it’s because Welch herself, who would go on to play an integral role in Americana’s big-bang &lt;i&gt;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&lt;/i&gt; soundtrack just a few years later, has since become the very aesthetic and artistic paradigm for 21st-century roots singer-songwriters. Or, perhaps, it’s because the anxieties about Welch’s authentic credentials were so misguided in the first place.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Listening to a &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1934-kristin-hersh/"&gt;Kristin Hersh&lt;/a&gt; album is like receiving, unfiltered, a direct feed of someone’s thoughts, with all the internal symbols, memories, private jokes intact before they apply all the translation and explanation and interpretation to the outside world. One gets the sense she’s still trying to sort through it all herself. For this reason, her music inevitably is called “abstract”; it’s an understandable reaction, but totally inaccurate. Kristin Hersh writes in specifics. Her memoir &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Rat Girl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;alternately&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; titled &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Paradoxical Undressing, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;a typically allegorical reference to hypothermia patients stripping off their clothes even as they freeze to death—sheds light on a couple dozen of her and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4232-throwing-muses/"&gt;Throwing Muses&lt;/a&gt;’ tracks. Her songs are full of references to her own material,anecdotes that slip out in interviews and on stage, blunt and hyper-specific wisecracks. Singer-songwriters, particularly women, are often accused of writing confessional material even (especially?) when they’re not, but Hersh’s material generally is. “I haven’t got the kind of brain to invent anything, so I just write the stuff down that happens,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://soundblab.com/features/interviews/16512-kristin-hersh" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;she told Soundblab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. “The things that happened are so bizarre, you can’t make those things up.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Wyatt at the Coyote Palace &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;(named for one of her sons) is a typically personal and idiosyncratic affair. Like all her solo and Throwing Muses studio releases since 2010’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Crooked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Wyatt at the Coyote Palace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is accompanied by a book of essays and artwork: less commentary on the tracks, and more another set of puzzle pieces to put together. (As well as a recipe for “hooker gazpacho.”) Like 1999’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sky Motel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, the sonics are rich; in addition to acoustic guitar, Hersh plays bass, drums, piano, horns, and cello, and engineer Steve Rizzo helps make it among her slickest-sounding recordings. After five years of tweaking results, she builds many of the arrangements to the beefiness of a typical Muses track; others are interspersed with muffled field recordings, an effect like hearing songs through mental fog. Like the Throwing Muses comeback album &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18660-throwing-muses-purgatoryparadise/"&gt;Purgatory/Paradise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, the album is fragmentary and self-referential; songs reappear throughout the album in reprises, or reworks of and callbacks to past material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;And like her 2001 solo effort &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sunny Border Blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, the album is viscerally preoccupied with loss: “I'm so fucking tired of dissolution,” Hersh says in “Sun Blown.” Sometimes it’s general loss—the running joke throughout the album’s accompanying essays is Hersh and her bandmates’ brushes with death, both funny and sneakily serious (a fair amount of essays end in the hospital). A few years ago Hersh divorced from her husband of 25 years. It’s crept into all her work since—last year’s book &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/946-kristin-hershs-dont-suck-dont-die-giving-up-vic-chesnutt/"&gt;Don’t Suck Don’t Die&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;started out as a eulogy for singer-songwriter &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/740-vic-chesnutt/"&gt;Vic Chesnutt&lt;/a&gt; but became a concurrent eulogy for the two songwriters’ marriages. But “Sun Blown” is perhaps the most explicit she's been: “The bailing mate dance, failing patience, fool's silver...” Like most of Hersh’s imagery, it’s not oblique at all when you get the reference: in this case, silver being the traditional 25th anniversary gift. The verse appears as a refrain throughout the album: leading into “Green Screen” and its descending counterpoint of a melody: “Red skin blackening, what is happening? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The Art of Kissing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, the heart of missing you.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Unsurprisingly, this is heavy listening. “Shaky Blue Can,” “Shotgun” (reminiscent of “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPJJ89gwfk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Terra Nova&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;”) and “Secret Codes” are up there with “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQEy_Dzkx30" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Listerine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;” and “Flooding” as among the most fragile material Hersh has recorded. But her work is always threaded through with levity; these songs resist easy classification. “Detox” breaks through into anger—confrontational lyrics, distorted guitar solo—but the almost poppy “Wonderland” recalls the Muses’ midcareer singles; “Hemingway’s Tell” could easily be adapted into one. For every bracing line like “everyone like me’s a dead man,” there’s a gnomic one-liner like “Incense, strawberry candles and soap—way to butcher a street.” The former track, “Killing Two Birds,” is deceptively cheery—the essay accompanying it sets it during a teenage coke-fueled jog. The latter, “Between Piety and Desire” (like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Purgatory/Paradise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, a play on street names) becomes a “we don’t like the shit, ‘cause we belong in it.” The “we” is key. As memoirs, her albums are so intensely personal it’s little wonder she’s amassed a cult fanbase (and cadre of crowdfunders); as art, they’re arguments for the value of unapologetic individuality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It’s not clear whether &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Free Bricks 2: Zone 6 Edition &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is supposed to exist. &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"&gt;Future&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"&gt;Gucci Mane&lt;/a&gt;’s new six-song exercise has been scrubbed from the Soundcloud page that birthed it and left to kick around in inconspicuous tracks bundles or in the YouTube ether. It came with no warning and left with little fanfare, a nineteen-minute exhale from two of the most visible and, probably, overworked rappers in the world. Unless one of these songs pops off under new packaging, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Free Bricks 2 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is probably going to come and go (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The Return of East Atlanta Santa &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;in stores December 16). Which is a shame, because &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Free Bricks 2 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is pretty potent dose of what makes Future and Gucci Mane so magnetic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Written and recorded in less than 24 hours, the sequel to 2011’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Free Bricks &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is fresh to a fault, with a few cadences that could have been smoothed out, a few points where Gucci still sounds as if he’s getting his post-prison footing. (Speaking of timeliness and Terre Haute, an otherwise unmemorable line about Monica Lewinsky from opener “RR Trucks” sticks in your brain because of Gucci’s heart-wrenching &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FLMemorialUniv/status/795793771946446849" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;get out the vote speech&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; from earlier this month.) Also endearing: two cult heroes decide to open their new record with a song about maybe, at some indeterminate point in the future, buying a new car they’ve heard about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Selling Heroin,” which Southside furnishes with a beautiful bounce is, decidedly, a Gucci Mane song. This proves to be a freeing thing for Future. Since &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19221-future-honest/"&gt;Honest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; was received coolly by his hardcore fanbase, the preposterously good-looking Atlantan has retreated to his wheelhouse. The career-defining run that began on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Monster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, became codified on &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20424-56-nights/"&gt;56 Nights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and culminated with last July’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20810-dirty-sprite-2/"&gt;DS2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; was built almost exclusively on songs that forewent the joy or R&amp;amp;B experimentation of his first two LPs. Here, Future comes unhinged just a little; most importantly, he sounds like he’s having fun. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As for Gucci, he’s been on a slow ramp up since his release from custody. This summer’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22157-gucci-mane-everybody-looking/"&gt;Everybody Looking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;was solid, but would have been unremarkable if it came out during his storied mixtape run; last month’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22522-woptober/"&gt;Woptober&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;has more world-class rapping than its predecessor, but no songs that will significantly alter the Gucci canon. While his pen seems mostly intact, the Zone 6 legend can’t quite find the right vocal register, what with the massive weight loss and newfound sobriety. This is likely to be sorted out soon, but in the meantime there are moments when he sounds like he’s searching. There are also brief passages where Gucci’s vocals come unmoored from the beat in a way his more laconic early-Obama self seldom did. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;But Gucci finds the pocket frequently on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Free Bricks 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and the result is always a joy. On “Die a Gangsta,” he raps: “They call me East Atlanta Santa, I’ma fuck up the profit/I’m the Grinch that stole Christmas, I might go in your stocking/I’m talking, too cocky, I got so much juice/My wrist is too rocky, they done let Wop loose.” Even if Future’s cool disaffect is en vogue, Gucci is the record’s emotional center, and when he’s booking luxe hotel room penthouses for shooters or buying his sixteenth Bentley, he’s the only rapper in the world you want to listen to. That’s the insane gravitational pull that Gucci’s somehow managed to harness: when he’s on, not only is he endlessly listenable, he renders his fiercest competition an afterthought. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Free Bricks 2 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;benefits from a superb production lineup—Southside and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32198-metro-boomin/"&gt;Metro Boomin&lt;/a&gt; split duties, except for when they pass the baton to &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/33949-zaytoven/"&gt;Zaytoven&lt;/a&gt;, who’s played a crucial role in ushering each rapper into the limelight. Zay helms “Kind a Dope,” the record’s highlight, where Gucci channels &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Ridin’ Dirty &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;and raps, “When you was playing basketball, man, I was playing Pimp C.” This little piece of Gucci's legacy is forgotten, and it’s the crux of why a tape like this can be so impressive; even if Future and Gucci Mane are cast as instinctive, impulsive savants, each is drawing on a wealth of musical knowledge that informs their work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Free Bricks 2 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;will likely get lost in the shuffle, but it’s the sound of two superlative talents working without boundaries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“ring spiel” tour ’95&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; captures one night in a superstar tour that assembled in support of the legendary &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4558-mike-watt/"&gt;Mike Watt&lt;/a&gt;’s  first solo album, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Ball-Hog or Tugboat?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;  The former-&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6048-minutemen/"&gt;Minutemen&lt;/a&gt; bass player turned &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/17834-firehose/"&gt;fIREHOSE&lt;/a&gt; band leader gathered an insane and unlikely roster of alternative-rock superstars to not only support his album, but follow him on tour. &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1005-evan-dando/"&gt;Evan Dando&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6422-kathleen-hanna/"&gt;Kathleen Hanna&lt;/a&gt;, Ad-Rock and Mike D, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/7328-eddie-vedder/"&gt;Eddie Vedder&lt;/a&gt;, the Kirkwood brothers, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/23242-dave-pirner/"&gt;Dave Pirner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/8214-dave-grohl/"&gt;Dave Grohl&lt;/a&gt; and Krist Novoselic, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"&gt;J Mascis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/778-nels-cline/"&gt;Nels Cline&lt;/a&gt;, half of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"&gt;Sonic Youth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2422-mark-lanegan/"&gt;Mark Lanegan&lt;/a&gt;— these are just a few of the names in the long, long credits list. The title of the live record, recorded at the Metro in Chicago on May 6, 1995, references Watt’s concept of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Ball-Hog or Tugboat?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; as being a wrestling match, where each group of musicians “got in the ring” with Watt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The touring band for “&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;ing spiel” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;would end up being Grohl, Vedder, Pat Smear, and William Goldsmith, freshly ex-&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3986-sunny-day-real-estate/"&gt;Sunny Day Real Estate&lt;/a&gt; and newly christened &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1534-foo-fighters/"&gt;Foo Fighter&lt;/a&gt;. Opening were Hovercraft, the multi-media project helmed by Beth Liebling (whose husband happened to be Vedder) and the then-fledgling Foo Fighters. The tour was run according to Watt’s ‘we jam econo’ ethos from back in the Minutemen days; there were no fancy tour buses, no blacked-out windows; everyone was in a van, driving themselves to gigs, 31 shows in 42 days, the kind of thing that Watt could do in his sleep. The kids, although they were more famous, needed to keep up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The tickets were sold as a Mike Watt show, and as the liner notes (written by Michael Azerrad) point out, promoters were under strict instructions to not use Grohl or Vedder to promote the tour. But the jig was up, not because of local promoters trying to sell tickets, but because of fan networks on the internet. The Nirvana, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3272-pearl-jam/"&gt;Pearl Jam&lt;/a&gt; and even Foo Fighters fan bases were already well-entrenched, and word travelled fast, via Usenet and BBS and listserv. Then MTV showed up to a gig and poked their nose around, and any pretense of subterfuge was gone. Vedder could wear a floppy hat and drum in back of Hovercraft’s video projections all he wanted to, but the remaining shows, all in theaters and clubs, far below Pearl Jam or Nirvana capacities, sold out quickly. This was undoubtedly bittersweet: on the one hand, getting Watt in front of a larger audience was surely part of the point of the parade of stars on the record; on the other, the star power's ability to hang back in the shadows was gone, the Halloween costume (in the case of Vedder, a wig) removed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;But the newfound attention didn’t distract the band from the task at hand: the show. &lt;i&gt;“r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;ing sp&lt;/i&gt;iel” tour ’95&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; catches the band about halfway through the outing, and they’re tight and cohesive: for all of the econo ethic of the tour, it’s their hard-earned experience of the musicians that makes them tremendous. As a concert package, it was a great lineup: Hovercraft’s psychedelic shimmer as an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;amuse-bouche&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, followed by the explosive energy of the early Foo Fighters, and then the journeyman punk rock stylings of Mr. Watt and his group. The set, as represented here on the live album, was constructed from eight of the 17 songs on the record, along with well-chosen covers of songs by the Minutemen, fIREHOSE, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/"&gt;Madonna&lt;/a&gt;, Blue Oyster Cult, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2202-daniel-johnston/"&gt;Daniel Johnston&lt;/a&gt;, and others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The 16-song set veers around punk and country and country-punk, as well as flat-out pop (“Piss-Bottle Man,” improbably enough), and it’s tight and well-sequenced and varied in texture, just like a package-tour set needs to be. Watt had fIREHOSE fans and his credentials from his days in Minutemen were unquestionable, but you don’t assemble a roster of high-powered guests for your record to fade into oblivion. Hopefully, a kid who liked &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4936-the-lemonheads/"&gt;the Lemonheads&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3538-red-hot-chili-peppers/"&gt;Red Hot Chili Peppers&lt;/a&gt;, or never got to see Nirvana would come check out the album or the tour, and become a fan of Mike Watt.&lt;/span&gt; Or so that was the thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The songs from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Ball-Hog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;… absolutely hold their own against the rest of the material. “Forever...One Reporter’s Opinion” maintains the urgency of the Minutemen original, Pat Smear on lead vocals sounding like he wrote it himself. “Chinese Firedrill” pulls straight from the Flying Burrito heart of California folk rock with no irony. “E-Ticket Ride” has a jazz-like energy, with both Grohl and Goldsmith on drums, complementing each other seamlessly as though they’d been playing together forever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Against the ’70s” would end up being the most well-known song from the record, because it was a duet with the then-reclusive Eddie Vedder. Later in the set, Vedder has a solo turn where he breaks out what would become a new Pearl Jam song: “Habit” would see the light of day on 1996’s &lt;i&gt;No Code&lt;/i&gt;. Stripped down to essentials and anchored by Watt’s fat, fluid notes, “Habit” feels like it belongs here as much as anything else in the set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The encores are fun: “The Red and the Black” by Blue Oyster Cult, who were kissing cousins on the edge of punk, and an old Watt/Minutemen love, becomes a pneumatic drill when in the hands of these guys, with Grohl taking lead guitar. But the real esoteric number is the Madonna cover, a Ciccone Youth special interpretation of “Secret Garden” from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Erotica&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, sung with love and camp by Pat Smear, powered only by Watt and Goldsmith, not that far away from the original arrangement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;At their best, live albums capture not just a concert performance, but also document the energy and the context around the music. &lt;i&gt;“r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;ing spiel” tou&lt;/i&gt;r ’95&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; manages to accomplish all of the above; it’s a nice time capsule if you were there, and it’s a great document to have if you weren’t, commemorating early years of musicians who are now canonic. &lt;/span&gt;At one point, Watt admonishes what were undoubtedly a disproportionate amount of amateur crowd-surfers: “Do you like those people rolling all over your heads?” (The crowd responds with a unanimous “No.”) “Then why don’t we give it a rest. Have to have your old man come up here and act like a fucking cop, to tell you that shit,” Watt says, the disgust obvious in his voice. &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;If nothing else, this tour is a tribute to his instincts as a band leader, and a scene elder. He might have had some trepidation on starting over after ending fIREHOSE, but this record proves that he never should have doubted his instincts onstage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fingerpicked acoustic guitar is a hit-or-miss proposition: When it works, the rolling, repetitive figures it produces can be hypnotic. But it’s easy for even a great player to drift into auto-pilot. The antidote seems pretty simple—pause, stretch, slow, or otherwise disrupt your habits—but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. Muscle memory is hard to kick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In all of his work so far, guitarist &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30783-daniel-bachman/"&gt;Daniel Bachman&lt;/a&gt; has avoided the traps of robotic fingerpicking. But on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Daniel Bachman—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;his eighth solo album, and second self-titled one—he does so with a new level of sophistication. It’s his most thoughtful release to date, filled with mindful reflection and confident patience. Even during his snappiest songs, Bachman takes time to consider where he is and where he’s going. When his pace starts to rush, he pulls back, ringing out a long chord or even stopping completely to avoid just going with the flow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The two clearest examples are the tracks that open each side of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Daniel Bachman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, both called “Brightleaf Blues.” In each, he uses sustained tones rather than flurries of string-picking to build atmosphere. The first half of the album’s opener is a high-pitched drone, followed by gradual strums and plucks that are more about exploration than exposition. Drone is the also backbone of the second “Brightleaf Blues,” humming in the background as Bachman feels his way through open-ended guitar figures. He achieves the same effect without drone in “A Dog Named Pepper,” progressing and retreating at intervals so well-timed they seem elemental, as if his fingers were guided by the moon and the tides.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;An album of only halting, measured music would likely make Bachman’s thoughtful playing seem flat, so he wisely includes some tunes made in a more traditional early-blues style. The raga-like “The Flower Tree,” the twangy “Wine and Peanuts,” and the chord-bending “Watermelon Slices on a Blue Bordered Plate” all fit this bill well, creating lively swing while still allowing Bachman room to contemplate and reset. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Most song titles on &lt;i&gt;Daniel Bachman&lt;/i&gt; include images from nature, suggesting this album is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;environmentally aware—not in the eco-activist sense, but in the sense of Bachman taking stock of his surroundings. He’s almost literally stopping to smell the roses, and the result is an album about growth and development, about the virtues of taking your time rather than the crutch of constantly sprinting forward. In the process, it advances Bachman’s oeuvre significantly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The past twenty five years haven’t exactly been kind to &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2746-metallica/"&gt;Metallica&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since their mainstream-rock apotheosis on 1991’s &lt;i&gt;Metallica&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; they’ve faced a quarter-century losing streak: the bloated hard rock of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Reload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Garage Inc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, the snoozy live album-cum-orchestral-experiment &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;S&amp;amp;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, the migraine-inducing ineptitude of &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5250-st-anger/"&gt;St. Anger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and the recycled rage of &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12180-death-magnetic/"&gt;Death Magnetic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. In 2011, they teamed up with &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"&gt;Lou Reed&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15996-lou-reed-metallica/"&gt;Lulu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, a collaborative concept album regarded by many as music’s answer to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The Room—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;if Tommy Wiseau’s classic was twice as ambitious and half as competent—and the band’s undeniable low point (and that’s even &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; the tell-all masochism of 2003’s documentary &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Some Kind of Monster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Money, fame, age, a lack of passion: Critics have floated several culprits for the mediocrity of latter-day Metallica. But as drummer Lars Ulrich suggested in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/lars-ulrich-on-metallicas-darkest-times-napster-battle-w448546" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;recent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Rolling Stone &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;interview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, the wellspring of the band’s foibles also forms the basis of Metallica writ large. “The thing that I love about Metallica is that we’re very impulsive,” Ulrich said, before tacking on a subtle &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;mea culpa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;: “That impulsivity occasionally bites us in the ass, because we jump before we know where we're landing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;And so, five years after hooking up with Lou, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;eight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; years after their last album proper, Metallica have taken yet another leap with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Hardwired...to Self-Destruct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, a two-disc collection demarcated not by a leap into the unknown, but into the halcyon days of their youth nearly three decades ago during thrash’s primordial period, when “impulsivity” amounted to unpredictable fretwork, breakneck rhythms, and discarded pretenses. Like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Death Magnetic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, the record attempts a self-conscious return to form; the only difference is that this time the band sound like they’re actually trying, and–dare I say it–maybe even having a bit of fun. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Hardwired...to Self-Destruct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is a rare Metallica album without any Kirk Hammett songwriting credits, a  shift owed not to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Some Kind of Monster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;-type bickering, but flat-out carelessness: The guitarist lost an iPhone containing roughly 250 riffs, leaving him with little to contribute to the think tank by the time Metallica began cutting the album. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Temporarily demoted from puppet master to personnel, Hammett readily embraces–relishes, even–his role as primary ambassador for Metallica nostalgia.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Hardwired&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;… stands as the guitarist’s most extensive show of muscle since the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;self-titled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; days. From the soaring, bluesy triplets on “Atlas, Rise!” to the fleet-footed stampedes driving “Spit Out the Bone,” his playing strikes a winning compromise between precision and wildness, lending the otherwise one-dimensional mix (undermined primarily by the anemic drum tracking, which renders Ulrich’s bass kicks little more than footsie taps) some welcome textural spontaneity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As for spontaneity on a broader level—don’t head into &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Hardwired... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;hoping for progressive surprises or unanticipated turns. Its twelve songs–the vast majority of which extend well past the five-minute mark–fall into two categories: galloping nods to &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21755-kill-em-allride-the-lightning/"&gt;Ride the Lightning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, of which the first disc is primarily composed, and doomier mid-tempo cuts à la &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"&gt;Sabbath&lt;/a&gt;, which make up the bulk of the second. The LP’s highlights—“Hardwired,” “Moth Into Flame,” “Atlas, Rise!” all fall into the former camp, front-loading the record with fire. The second disc, by contrast, is a slog through nondescript, uniform chug, devoid of dynamics or instrumental nuance: “Confusion”’s dull roar proves practically indistinguishable from the slow-churning gyre of “ManUNkind” or “Here Comes Revenge,” and the clunky mainframe of “Murder One” borders on incoherent. Fortunately, they finish strong with “Spit Out the Bone,” a galvanizing, hyper-speed premonition of a world razed to the ground by man’s greed for shiny playthings (like, say, Hammett’s iPhone): “Plug into me and terminate/Accelerate, Utopian solution/Finally cure the Earth of Man.” A little less than three minutes in, the band automize fiercely, careening off the leaden path into a pummeling breakdown unheard since the glory days. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Elsewhere, James Hetfield redeems himself as Metallica’s growling figurehead with his strongest work in decades. The band’s 2014 tribute medley to fallen star &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/12190-ronnie-james-dio/"&gt;Ronnie James Dio&lt;/a&gt; (which appears on the deluxe edition of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Hardwired&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;…) has clearly left a lasting impression on the 53-year-old, vocally and lyrically: whereas past releases found Hetfield howling the blues and roaringly introducing himself as literal furniture, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Hardwired&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;… marks a return to the matter-of-fact, staccato doomsday proselytizing of the band’s heyday. When he barks “We’re so fucked/Shit out of luck,” on the title track, teeth bared, fists clenched, we feel the pulse of his reckless youth ever-so-slightly—and for a second, the multi-millionaire feels like one of us, shaking in timely trepidation at the realization of the world’s greatest fears. And yet, even as he manages to rein in the cringeworthy wailing exhibited on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;St. Anger &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; albums, he can’t resist backsliding into melodrama—obnoxiously extending out his syllables on “Now That We’re Dead” (“Now that we’re dead my DEEE-AHH we can be TOGETH-AHH”)–and on “Dream No More,” letting out a grunge-era whine that sounds like a failed impersonation of late legend &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4570-scott-weiland/"&gt;Scott Weiland&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Make no mistake—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Hardwired... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;s easily Metallica’s best album since 1991’s landmark self-titled LP, a victory on par with &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"&gt;Weezer&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21593-weezer-white-album/"&gt;White Album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;for comeback of the year. But as was the case with Cuomo and company, the album fails to convince non-diehards what, exactly, we look for from Metallica these days. Even after repeat listens, one can’t shake the feeling that in 2016, the legends’ students have become their teachers in terms of both sheer volume and political gravitas; those looking for fresh thrash, in its purest, most primal form are better off listening to the likes of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/33538-vektor/"&gt;Vektor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31190-power-trip/"&gt;Power Trip&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32388-iron-reagan/"&gt;Iron Reagan&lt;/a&gt;, who wave the torch of their forebears with considerably more gusto. Still, the band couldn’t return at a better time: when you flip on the news and see a narcissistic, trigger-fingered, despotic cheetoh at the podium—a Metallica song come to life—there’s no denying that the accessible aggro makes for a surprisingly potent balm, not to mention an enjoyable form of escapism. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30240-porter-ricks/"&gt;Porter Ricks&lt;/a&gt;, the duo of Andy Mellwig and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/25144-thomas-koner/"&gt;Thomas Köner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;weren’t around for long, but they left an indelible stamp on the legacy of what came to be known as dub techno. Ironically, there was never very much dub in their work—not in the way that you could hear it ricocheting through the work of their colleagues &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/19435-basic-channel/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Basic Channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, for instance, upon whose Chain Reaction label Porter Ricks released their debut album, in 1996. In Basic Channel’s music, dub is a root, transplanted from Jamaica, that will eventually branch into the full-scale reggae of their later &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4937-rhythm-sound/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Rhythm &amp;amp; Sound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; project. In Porter Ricks’ music, dub is less a root than a route, a way of tracing the path a sound can travel through the convoluted guts of the recording studio. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In Porter Ricks’ short, largely bulletproof catalog—save for a few exploratory detours on their second album, into hip-hop and Chicago house, that probably would have been better left untaken—drum machines are run through maze-like circuits until nothing remains but the infrared signature they have left in their wake. Their commitment to conjuring whole worlds out of little more than crackle and echo cast a long shadow, even though they &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;put the project on hold after three short years. Without Porter Ricks, it’s hard to imagine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3352-pole/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Pole&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/8811-shackleton/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Shackleton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Burial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, or any number of artists working in the most densely crosshatched corners of electronic music. Their last album was 1999’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Symbiotics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, a split LP with Techno Animal (the industrial duo of Kevin Martin, later known as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/539-the-bug/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;the Bug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5682-justin-k-broadrick/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Justin K. Broadrick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, a veteran of a host of bands like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5443-napalm-death/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Napalm Death&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32310-godflesh/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Godflesh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and Ice) on which their gravelly sound came to resemble something alive and malevolent, their synths’ jagged waveforms glinting like the teeth of a snarling animal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;On their first new work in 17 years, not much has outwardly changed—and really, that’s the best possible scenario. When they called it quits, they were still in the process of pushing their sound forward, so for them to pick up where they left off is a welcome development. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Shadow Boat &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;consists of just three tracks, but they cover a considerable amount of ground. “Harbour Chart” creeps ahead at 60 beats per minute, faint kick and hi-hat all but subsumed in a maelstrom of foghorns and static. “Bay Rouge” is faster, a brisk andante of glancing chords and metallic textures. The timing of the release couldn't be more perfect, given the way the track's movements mimic kicking up piles of dry autumn leaves; the whole thing is crisp, chilly, and brooding. “Shadow Boat” is the longest, quickest, and most intense of the bunch, a headlong tumble into a wind-tunnel rave, its synths rattling like a broken screen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Porter Ricks always excelled at sketching out sweeping, subaquatic expanses—ironically, their name comes from a character on the 1960s television series &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Flipper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, a children’s show about a dolphin, even though there’s nothing cuddly about their music—and that continues to be the case here; the sense of space suggested by all three tracks is immense, practically unbounded. For years, most dub techno records have concerned themselves with nothing more than dub techno itself, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Shadow Boat &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;tackles bigger ideas: Its main subject is the interplay of uncontrollable forces. All three tracks, balancing four-to-the-floor beats with unpredictable explosions of sandblasted tone, explore the tension between steadiness and turmoil. On the one hand, the certainty of timekeeping; on the other, things ripped loose from their fixtures. (“Shadow Boat” would have made a great soundtrack to Alfonso Cuarón’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Gravity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, playing the regularity of the spacecraft’s orbit against its spectacularly violent pulverization.) Ultimately, it’s not about chaos, exactly, but something like it: unpredictable, dubwise chain reactions that leave us cowed and awestruck—patterns whose complexity we can scarcely begin to apprehend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The highlights from the meticulously recorded 2014 &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30653-bodyhead/"&gt;Body/Head&lt;/a&gt; live set at Big Ears selected for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;No Waves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; clock in all together at only 40 minutes, which is &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;xactly&lt;/i&gt; the point at which those of us with punk training start to get restless beyond consolation in live settings. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;No Waves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is, in its essence, tenuously and perfectly balanced between experimental challenge and punk efficiency. At first listen, it may seem wild and free; under deep scrutiny, it’s extremely artful, no moment out of place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This should come as little surprise to anyone familiar with either half of Body/Head, Bill Nace or &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1763-kim-gordon/"&gt;Kim Gordon&lt;/a&gt;. Nace is an extraordinarily skilled improvisational guitarist who’s collaborated with contemporary greats like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6794-chris-corsano/"&gt;Chris Corsano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/15675-jessica-rylan/"&gt;Jessica Rylan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1834-mats-gustafsson/"&gt;Mats Gustafsson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/7565-joe-mcphee/"&gt;Joe McPhee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/18273-paul-flaherty/"&gt;Paul Flaherty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29205-bill-orcutt/"&gt;Bill Orcutt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/19488-okkyung-lee/"&gt;Okkyung Lee&lt;/a&gt;—the list goes on. What remains audible through all of these disparate collaborations is his core skill—as are all titans of improvisation, he is highly adaptable, and above all, an excellent listener. His style is unmistakable, but he never forces his collaborators to bend to it. Instead, he stretches elastic, copper, and rough twine sounds around the structures his collaborators build; it’s magical to observe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. Gordon, for her part, has a noted ear for breaking apart pop songcraft; in &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"&gt;Sonic Youth&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1555-free-kitten/"&gt;Free Kitten&lt;/a&gt;, and with Body/Head, she’s always written bass and guitar lines that are as indelibly catchy as they are inscrutable. There’s always a delightfully missing hinge to what she builds, urging the listener to push open the door instinctively only to watch the entire frame crumble. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Of the two shorter tracks, “Sugar Water” and “The Show Is Over,” only the latter has a studio counterpart, while “Abstract/Actress” takes two tracks from Body/Head’s debut, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18471-bodyhead-coming-apart/"&gt;Coming Apart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and blurs them together into a thick, tense paste. If the versions of these songs on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Coming Apart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; sometimes felt like never-ending spiral staircases from a surreal dreamscape, their mutated live representation paws the ground, less Escher-esque than Baba Yaga’s hut—dream gone nightmare; landscape gone mythic hell. The track takes up the bulk of the album, and yet it never becomes boring and never feels long. There are nods within to no-wave scrawl, to free jazz freakout, to pop hook, and to psychedelic drone. It’s exhilarating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Sugar Water” is nothing short of beautiful, Nace’s and Gordon’s guitars delicately chiming together, their clangor blending smoothly into a murky dissonance, like church bells. Gordon’s voice twists over the top, wordless, serving as an instrumental tone unto itself, as she has often deployed it. “The Show Is Over” ping-pongs between placid ambience and blown-out, quick-strummed frenzy; Raymond Pettibon’s cover art (far from the gnarly punk line work he’s perhaps best known for, but congruent with his lifelong usage of greens, blues, and yellows, as well as his fat scroll-like brush technique) depicts a seemingly calm lake (the &lt;i&gt;No Waves&lt;/i&gt; title, after all, is not just a play on a a genre name), and one may be reminded of that art particularly by this song; how quickly the wind can kick up, how quickly a fresh-water monster could emerge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The dynamism of all three tracks is another of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;No Waves’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;greatest strengths; where Body/Head’s studio work is all matte-finished and fascinatingly horizontal, here their interplay stands up in full, palpable relief. The recording retains the crackling live energy and natural ease of the set without sacrificing clarity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;No Waves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; stands as a memorable document on its own &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; a hopeful harbinger for new material to come.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There is a surprising amount of music inspired by particle accelerators. Techno-classical producer &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5992-kate-simko/"&gt;Kate Simko&lt;/a&gt; wrote &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13137-music-from-the-atom-smashers/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;an album about the one at Fermilab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, located outside her hometown of Chicago. Jazz pianist Al Blatter once &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-33468545" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;improvised along to a “sonification” program&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; that translates data collected by the Large Hadron Collider into music on stage at the Montreux Jazz Festival, where CERN, the multinational research organization that runs the LHC, has held several artist workshops. Sound artist Bill Fontana created a piece that used the LHC itself as an instrument, refracting sound generated by its own data. The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/j50ZssEojtM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;LHC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oaG6umMkbxg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Fermilab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; have each inspired their own not-particularly-good nerdcore rap anthem, complete with inter-lab beef.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;So &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1955-his-name-is-alive/"&gt;His Name Is Alive&lt;/a&gt; isn’t breaking new conceptual ground by taking the LHC as the inspiration for their new album &lt;i&gt;Patterns of Light&lt;/i&gt;, but where they’ve taken that influence is entirely uncharted territory. Previous works in strange little niche have crossed multiple genre lines, but there’s always been a consistent aesthetic: clean-lined, blippy, and serene, like what you’d expect to find in a PBS documentary, or what you might imagine a massively powerful and complex piece of technology might listen to for fun. His Name Is Alive mastermind Warren Defever has gone pretty much the exact opposite way, filtering the idea of the LHC through the stonier side of ’70s rock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Defever has spent the past 25 years picking a strange course through a field of genres that up until now has touched on goth, folk, R&amp;amp;B, noise, and chamber pop, but even with all that range, &lt;i&gt;Patterns of Light&lt;/i&gt; feels like an outlier. Even if you heard 2014’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19965-his-name-is-alive-tecuciztecatl/"&gt;Tecuciztecatl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, where the band merged shoegazey noise with vintage prog, you’ll still probably be caught off guard when the album opens with a track that–apart from the hypnotic multitrack cooing of vocalist-keyboardist Andrea Morici–sounds exactly like Dio-era &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"&gt;Black Sabbath&lt;/a&gt;. It’s by far the heaviest, shreddiest, most aggressive thing Defever’s ever done, and, as far as I can tell, entirely unlike any other music ever composed for CERN.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The major difference is that past artists seem to have been inspired by the Large Hadron Collider’s earthly manifestation: the sleek lines of its beam-conducting apparatus, its intricate computer arrays, the pixelated action art of its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/2114784/files/jets_v0.png?subformat=icon-1440" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;data visualizations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. Defever, on the other hand, considers it from a more cosmic perspective, which the LHC offers in abundance. After all, this is a machine that was built in order to rip the veil off the mechanisms of reality, one designed in search of something that’s often been called the “God particle.” It’s so powerful and strange that a lot of people seriously thought that it was going to destroy the universe when it was first powered up. Even after it’s been up and running for years without tearing apart the fabric of reality, people are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/human-sacrifice-captured-at-cern/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;still terrified of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Patterns of Light&lt;/i&gt; runs on this occult energy. The lyrics—with their frequent invocations of witches, dragons, and the “light of creation”—often read like spells, where knives and sacrificial murder pop up next to dark matter and the standard model of particle physics. “Silver Arc Curving in the Magnetic Field” describes the LHC collider’s 17-mile-circumference circle like the ritual site of a new techno-pagan cult–just the latest iteration in a 3000-year-old tradition of earthworks inscribed into ancient Celtic land.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It also helps Defever’s direction in genre-hopping make stronger thematic sense here than on other His Name Is Alive albums. Classic metal and prog—which the band expertly executes on cuts like “Black Wings” and “Demonmix”—have long served as vehicles for high-concept, bong-smacked, “whoa, man” philosophizing. The sunshiney psych-pop of “Calling All Believers” bears a strong resemblance to the Canadian band Klaatu’s new age-y 1976 hit “Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft,” while the pastoral folk of “Dragon Down” sounds like it could have been lifted from a private press LP recorded by a Californian hippie cult. A front-to-back listen through &lt;i&gt;Patterns of Light&lt;/i&gt; can feel like a tour through all the places where pop radio and esoteric thought crossed paths during the ’70s, and a tribute to the ways both music and physics strive to explain a universe that can sometimes feel stubbornly unknowable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington, DC exists in a constant ominous haze. It’s no secret that this environment has given rise to absolutely vital punk through grassroots oppositional music scenes, from Dischord post-hardcore forebears like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/8999-rites-of-spring/"&gt;Rites of Spring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"&gt;Fugazi&lt;/a&gt; to the feminist Positive Force collective that fostered the East coast wing of riot grrrl. &lt;a href="http://sisterpolygonrecords.bigcartel.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sister Polygon&lt;/a&gt;, an eclectic record label run by the members of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31119-priests/"&gt;Priests&lt;/a&gt;, is helping to set up infrastructure for the latest wave. Their bands deploy many tactics: the confrontational urgency of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32890-downtown-boys/"&gt;Downtown Boys&lt;/a&gt; and Priests themselves, the tongue-in-cheek minimalism of Sneaks, the giddy polyphonics of Gauche. They all paint sonic critiques of broken systems and create effective models of resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/33687-flasher/"&gt;Flasher&lt;/a&gt;, made up of Taylor Mulitz (bassist in Priests), Emma Baker, and Daniel Saperstein, is the latest to emerge. They take a moody post-punk approach, crafting introspective songs that speak to selfhood and sublimation. “What happens when the continuity of self and the worlds you come to depend on shatter?” Flasher &lt;a href="http://www.fvckthemedia.com/issue69/flasher" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;told &lt;i&gt;The Media&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in April upon releasing their debut self-titled cassette, which is now being re-released on vinyl. “We’re trying to explore new forms of resistance, where being yourself ceases to be a matter of reliability and instead leans into emerging, shifting, and unsustainable senses of self.” The trio’s previous project, Young Trynas, addressed some of these themes on their 2013 EP &lt;i&gt;Probably Music&lt;/i&gt;, but on &lt;i&gt;Flasher&lt;/i&gt; they’re silkier, more stylized, well-honed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flasher’s airy melodic vocal hooks, layered over grungy instrumentation, earn comparisons to &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7349-goo-deluxe-edition/"&gt;Goo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;-era &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"&gt;Sonic Youth&lt;/a&gt;. The more relentless tracks, meanwhile, like “All Over,” recall the overdriven shoegaze of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5424-a-place-to-bury-strangers/"&gt;A Place to Bury Strangers&lt;/a&gt;. Call-and-response singing and classically ominous synths round out full, rich songs; each part sits perfectly in the mix. On the standout opener, “Tense,” a languid, taunting lead vocal faces off with another voice, which rattles out a laundry list of concerns: “The backseat/The answer/To society/Something greater/The body/Distant achievements/Further growth/Empty gesture.” Crashing waves of guitar nearly drown it out, but the bite of the words is persistent. “Tense” luxuriates in the tension between desire and responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, the tracks are more high-octane, built around mantras of being and nothingness. “I’ll erase myself/To release myself” vows the chorus of “&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18201-flasher-erase-myself/"&gt;Erase Myself&lt;/a&gt;”; “Is this becoming/Or am I succumbing?” asks “Make Out.” The object of immersion is never named; it could be society, or coupling, or the scene. Instead, the focus is on the lure of being consumed, its dark seduction. Closer “Destroy” can be read as a display of sweetly heartsick longing—the chorus crooning, “Starting to realize/I just want to be your boy”—or as a self-conscious critique of that form of desire. “Go destroy your feelings,” Mulitz sings, “Make a little room for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across &lt;i&gt;Flasher&lt;/i&gt;, dissociative existential questions are countered by the visceral physicality of the songs. This places the trio squarely in the tradition of punk that articulates how politics imprint on the body. “Throw It Away” shakes with every drum kick and guitar screech, recalling the angst of other Polygon projects with the repetition of lines like, “With god as my witness/This world is a sickness” and “Why should I be thankful?” But for all the tension and darkness, there’s a real joy to &lt;i&gt;Flasher&lt;/i&gt;—a knowing smile, a dream-pop slippage. It’s a fun listen that sounds like it was equally fun to make, which, after all the soul-searching, is a source of relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Over the course of their first four albums, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3509-radian/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Radian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; perfected a painterly approach to sound construction. What makes the instrumental Austrian trio exceptional is its ability to wrest seemingly endless possibilities by fine-tuning the grain of every sound. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;On their fifth album &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;On Dark Silent Off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, Radian take the tactile dimension of their music even further while also introducing groove and drama basically for the first time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;On Dark Silent Off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; bristles with a passion that you don't hear on their back catalog. It's not like past Radian records are stiff, but the band always sounded slightly removed as it supplied you with a constant flow of sensory input. This time, they connect with your heart too. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;On Dark Silent Off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; begins much as Radian's other albums do, with two minutes of instrumental textures building into a half-organic, half-synthetic hybrid: electric guitar chords strained through an amplifier, a bleeping electronic pulse, and drum sticks establishing a pattern on snare. As usual for them, the overall tone feels, if not cold, then at least impersonal, an exercise in modernist architecture that privileges audacity of form over comfort. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This time, the band relied heavily on transducers to project sounds onto various surfaces, a process not unlike replaying tracks through an amp or studio monitor to increase the feeling of spatial dimension. When new guitarist Martin Siewert plays guitar chords, it feels like you can reach out and touch the grill covering on his amplifier. You can hear air moving behind Siewert and Brandlmayr's array of electronic noises. If the music on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;On Dark Silent Off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; had been painted on a canvas, you'd notice the detail in the brush strokes from twenty feet away. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;But right around the two-minute mark of album opener “Pickup Pickout,” Radian switch into an actual groove, like a post-rock interpretation of a techno banger. Out of nowhere, the music starts to pant, sweat, and move. The sudden rush of humanity is startling. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The song ends with a repetitive, pulsing digital loop, and by that point Radian have covered more ground in one piece than they have on some of their entire past albums. &lt;/span&gt;In the same vein, a piece like “Recreate Loved Objects” unfolds like a suite, almost a mini-album unto itself, as its somber single-note guitar line traverses a shifting landscape of sounds. Suffice it to say the album doesn’t simply reward repeated listens, it demands them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Radian's brand of art rock has always gone down surprisingly smooth in whole-album servings, but they've outdone themselves on every level here. More limber and fiery than ever, the band has risen out the experimental cul-de-sac with a riveting work that should appeal to both its expected audience and to new fans who might have otherwise dismissed this style of music as too antiseptic for their liking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past few years have been both a bounty and something of an endurance test for &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"&gt;Autechre&lt;/a&gt; fans. This past May, the duo of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/11808-rob-brown/"&gt;Rob Brown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/11807-sean-booth/"&gt;Sean Booth&lt;/a&gt; released &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21950-elseq-1-5/"&gt;elseq 1-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, over four hours of new material. It earned comparisons to &lt;a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/19091" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;dumping off a bag of clothes at a second hand store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21950-elseq-1-5/"&gt;a Netflix show binge&lt;/a&gt;. That followed on the heels of last year’s AE_LIVE, which was over nine hours of live shows and 2013’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17691-autechre-exai/"&gt;Exai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, which ran for two hours (though still under the length of a modern superhero film). It sounds daunting—and yes, what the duo conjures up &lt;i&gt;sounds&lt;/i&gt; daunting—as Autechre is shorthand for a type of difficult strain of electronic music once deemed “intelligent dance music.” There’s a good chance the word “algorithm” will be used when writing about their music, and despite their longevity, they remain at the vanguard, the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/11694-cecil-taylor/"&gt;Cecil Taylors&lt;/a&gt; of their field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for all that impenetrability, there's a lifelong friendship and dialogue that takes place between the two, regardless of the fact they now live in separate cities, building and swapping MAX patches from a distance. It’s a dialogue begun back in the late ‘80s, when they were electro-obsessed teens coming up in Manchester, swapping ideas and tracks on cassette tapes, jamming on analog synths and drum machines in their flats. It’s a dialogue that you can parse on their earliest albums, &lt;i&gt;Incunabula&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Amber&lt;/i&gt;, finally reissued on vinyl after they’ve changed hands online for three-digit sums. That complex and private language is evident from the start, situating Brown and Booth as the &lt;a href="http://dangerousminds.net/comments/poto_and_cabengo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Poto and Cabengo&lt;/a&gt; of techno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eggshell,” from their 1993 debut &lt;i&gt;Incunabula&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;subtly reworks “The Egg,&lt;i&gt;” &lt;/i&gt;a track from the epochal &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11714-artificial-intelligence-artificial-intelligence-ii/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/i&gt; comp&lt;/a&gt; that forever saddled them with the “intelligent dance music” tag . The &lt;i&gt;Incunabula&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;track locates a purgatory between the graffiti-friendly snare and hi-hats and disarmingly gorgeous, slow-moving synth line that evolves almost without notice behind the beat. The landscapes they evoke can seem post-industrial and dystopian, but the chord progression of “Kalpol Introl” still feels melancholic and definitely &lt;i&gt;human&lt;/i&gt;. And while its approximately 75-minute length is unwarranted—the acid squelches of “Windwind” exhaust with their 11-minute runtime—there are both time-stamped presets as well as plenty of clues as to their evolution embedded in the album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An early highlight, “Bike,” finds Autechre at their most songful, the bolts-on-concrete sounds of the 808s giving way to a beautiful ambient passage before that metallic beat returns. Even odder is “Basscadet,” a fan-favorite hit of sorts back in 1994. Built from what sounds like a hand drum tattoo and featuring a cheeky vocal sample saying “I don’t have any idea ‘bout what’s going on,” it features the abrasive electronic tones and scoured-metal aesthetic that would soon become the keystone to their future work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year’s &lt;i&gt;Amber&lt;/i&gt; might most closely resemble &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"&gt;Aphex Twin&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/223-selected-ambient-works-85-92/"&gt;Selected Ambient Works 85-92&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, but even then it shows them subtly begin to slide away from their techno roots. Some of their most ambient tracks are here, though it also finds them favoring darker, more industrial timbres that earned those early &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31808-cabaret-voltaire/"&gt;Cabaret Voltaire&lt;/a&gt; comparisons. It’s still disarming to see them use real words like “Glitch” and “Montreal” rather than the semantic jumble that would soon define their tracks. “Foil” builds with a beat that sounds like a whip against the titular material, the turbid washes decidedly more malicious than on their debut. The synth melodies of “Slip” haven’t aged very well, and the sharper aspects of “Glitch” and “Piezo” feel dulled and gentle in hindsight, knowing just what nasty and brutish sounds they would soon wring out of their gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes &lt;i&gt;Amber&lt;/i&gt; fascinating to revisit decades on is to hear vestigial organs and sonic cul-de-sacs that Autechre would bin almost immediately after. Brown would look back and deem these melodic bits “&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/interview/6788-autechre/"&gt;cheesy&lt;/a&gt;” but if anything, it proves that at one point the duo was human after all. “Silverside” might be Autechre’s most haunted five minutes, even if the surge of orchestral soundtrack strings and distorted voice are two tricks that we’d never hear again. “Nine” might be the closest they ever got to the placid sounds of new age while “Further,” with its slow heaving minor key swells are as emotive as anything Autechre ever released. The flickering lullaby melody and spare pads of “Yulquen” reveal a soft, contemplative side that few could even identify as an Autechre track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 1995’s &lt;i&gt;Tri Repetae&lt;/i&gt;, Autechre obliterated all that they—and most of their Warp roster mates—had done before. Rather than cut away vestigial parts, they scoured off all flesh and “cheesy” bits entirely, trash-compacted their hard drives and went full cyborg instead. While Aphex Twin used a dentist drill-high frequency to wheeze atop his single &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/fa-8GsMhznc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;“Ventolin”&lt;/a&gt; earlier that year, Autechre made it their entire aesthetic, reconfiguring each component of their productions with that same level of sonic intensity. From the deep, sawing sinewave and rockslide of low tones that open “Dael” to the metallic thrums and chilling hiss of closer “Rsdio,” &lt;i&gt;Tri Repetae &lt;/i&gt;served as Autechre’s superhero origin story, revealing a monstrous new power while also obliterating any trace of their previous selves. Rather than be able to trace the twisted metal of &lt;i&gt;Tri Repetae&lt;/i&gt; to old Detroit techno singles and Mantronik sides, the lineage goes directly to &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2744-merzbow/"&gt;Merzbow&lt;/a&gt;’s white-knuckle noise and the hammered metal of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1306-einsturzende-neubauten/"&gt;Einstürzende Neubauten&lt;/a&gt;. They’d push into more experimental and complex music for the next twenty years and never quite be as gentle or linear as those first two efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pewter sleeve bereft of any markings, the images of metal shafts and casings suggest that the humans behind Autechre were replaced not with robots but rather old radiators instead. Since then, experimental and dance artists alike—be they on labels like PAN, Tri Angle or Editions Mego—have absorbed certain aspects of Autechre’s sound. Whether you go for &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"&gt;Oneohtrix Point Never&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/"&gt;Arca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30806-holly-herndon/"&gt;Holly Herndon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28070-russell-haswell/"&gt;Russell Haswell&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31448-powell/"&gt;Powell&lt;/a&gt;, they inhabit a world that Autechre helped make conceivable, so that even the cold metallic tones of their third album have somehow warmed with time. The bass growl that lurches forth on “Clipper” now feels triumphant rather than menacing, the whinnying frequencies of “Rotar” slowly tease out a melodic line. The spaceship vibrations of “Eutow” bears a low-rider beat at its center and the factory clatter of “Gnit” still reveals something quirky behind all the machinations. Revisiting &lt;i&gt;Tri Repetae&lt;/i&gt; twenty-one years later is like returning to a planet previously filled with sulfuric acid clouds, volcanoes and liquid mercury pools. A hostile, post-human sound at the time of its release, it’s now startling to find residents living and thriving there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"&gt;Leonard Cohen&lt;/a&gt; appeared on seven of his album covers before 1988, always looking cooler and wiser than his listeners: he was the saturnine poet, the seductive man of the world. On the cover of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I’m Your Man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; he looks better than ever, with his sunglasses and impeccable pinstripe suit—except that he’s eating a banana, the slapstick fruit. James Dean would not have looked cool eating a banana. Gandhi would not have looked wise. Cohen’s publicist Sharon Weisz snapped the picture at the video shoot for Jennifer Warnes’ version of “First We Take Manhattan” and thought nothing of it, but Cohen thought it summed up everything the album was saying about himself and the human condition: Just when you think you’ve got it all worked out, life hands you a banana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cohen was 53 when he released the album that reinvented him musically, vocally, linguistically, temperamentally and philosophically. It quickly became his most successful record since his 1967 debut and many people’s favorite. In Sylvie Simmons’ Cohen biography, also called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I’m Your Man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5441-black-francis/"&gt;Black Francis&lt;/a&gt; says: “Everything that’s sexy about him was extra sexy, anything funny about him extra funny, anything heavy was extra heavy.” Triple-espresso Cohen. Six of these eight songs were career highlights that featured on “The Essential Leonard Cohen” and his 2008 comeback tour. Over the years, they have been consistently covered and quoted and folded into popular culture. Not a bad strike rate for an album that, according to Cohen, “broke down three or four times in the making of it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cohen was on his knees when he made &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I’m Your Man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. His 1984 album &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Various Positions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; had revitalized his songwriting with his embrace of cheap synthesizers and contained “Hallelujah,” destined to become a modern standard, but it had been rejected by Columbia Records in the U.S. He was running out of money. Songwriting, never easy, had become “hard labor”—he had been struggling with “Anthem” and “Waiting for the Miracle” for years and wouldn’t nail them until his 1992 album &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The Future&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. Above (or below) all, he was poleaxed by depression, unable at one stage to get out of bed or answer the phone. He considered retiring and withdrawing to a monastery but he didn’t feel he had the spiritual mettle. He felt that the personality he had sustained for so many years—as an artist, lover, friend—was disintegrating. “My own situation was so disagreeable that most forms of failure hardly touched me,” he said. “That allowed me to take a lot of chances.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cohen clawed back his self-respect by telling the truth. His account of writing “I Can’t Forget” reminds me of Hemingway’s solution to creative block: “All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.” Originally, the song was about the Jews’ exodus from Egypt but Cohen felt he lacked the religious conviction to sing it. “I couldn’t get the words out of my throat,” he said. So he sat down at the kitchen table, abandoned any pretense to wisdom and began to write one true verse, a twist on &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2341-kris-kristofferson/"&gt;Kris Kristofferson&lt;/a&gt;’s “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down”: “I stumbled out of bed/I got ready for the struggle/I smoked a cigarette/And I tightened up my gut.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The actress Rebecca De Mornay, who began dating Cohen after &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I’m Your Man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, summarized his attitude at the time: “Let’s get down to the truth here. Let’s not kid ourselves.” The truth, as Cohen saw it, was bleak. He had reached the end of a period of spiritual inquiry. His investigations would resume during the ‘90s when he spent years studying with the Zen master Roshi on California’s Mount Baldy, but on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I’m Your Man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; he had reached a conclusion about how the world worked, and it gives the album a wry fatalism. His capacity for action is circumscribed by forces beyond his control. He is chained to music (“Tower of Song”), or a woman (“I’m Your Man”) or the memory of a woman (“Ain’t No Cure for Love”) and there’s nothing he can do about it. &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/a&gt; said that with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Various Positions &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cohen’s songs were becoming like prayers—“Hallelujah,” “If It Be Your Will”—but there are no prayers here, and nobody to answer them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To the extent that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I’m Your Man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is political—with its allusions to racism, inequality and the Shoah—it is the opposite of protest, because protest is futile here. The bomb has already dropped. The flood has occurred. The plague has arrived. The language of politics or religion or romance has lost its power to console or inspire. All that Cohen can do is describe the blasted terrain without flinching and find a way to inhabit it with some modicum of dignity. “I got some sense that the thing has been destroyed and is lost and that this world doesn’t exist, and this is the shadow of something, this is the fallout, the residue, the dust of some catastrophe, and there’s nothing to grasp onto,” said Cohen, demonstrating his ability to deliver an answer in an interview that’s as finely turned as a poem. The album describes the aftermath—a state beyond pessimism or anxiety or hope. “A pessimist is somebody who is waiting for the rain,” he said. “Me, I’m already wet.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I’m Your Man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is the most fun you can have while being told that life is a terrible joke. Because Cohen is a published poet and novelist and a limited musician, his grasp of pop music is often underrated, but he was enough of an entertainer to realize that this lyrical pill would require a lot of sweetening in the studio. The album began to take shape when Jeff Fisher, a keyboardist whom he had met in Montreal, arranged “First We Take Manhattan.” Cohen felt that if these words were couched in “serious Leonard Cohen music,” then they would be intolerable for both him and the listener. The song needed cinematic scope (Fisher’s version reminded him of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"&gt;Ennio Morricone&lt;/a&gt;’s work with Sergio Leone) and a beat you could dance to. The synthesizer enabled him to write to rhythms he couldn’t play on the guitar but it also connected him to cities, modernity, the tempo of the street. Fisher’s version, which resembles a militarized &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3290-pet-shop-boys/"&gt;Pet Shop Boys&lt;/a&gt;, convinced Cohen the album was possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Then there’s the voice, which had acquired a morbid gravitas ideally suited to delivering hard truths but was not yet a midnight croak. Cohen shows considerable range here, executing each syllable with deadly precision on “First We Take Manhattan”; as intimate as a late-night phone call on the title track; a more ravaged version of his younger self on “Take This Waltz”; jaded and urbane on “Tower of Song.” His backing singers Jennifer Warnes and Anjani Thomas serve as confidants, accomplices, angels and hecklers, encircling that voice like garlands on a statue. Finally, and most importantly, there are jokes. It may be the humor of the gulag or the cancer ward—the black comedy of low expectations—but no less funny for that. “When things get truly desperate,” said Cohen, “you start laughing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The only man of action on the record, the only optimist, is the deranged narrator of “First We Take Manhattan.” Cohen had become fascinated by extremist rhetoric, from the KKK to Hezbollah, because its “beautiful world of certainty of action” stood in exotic contrast to his own sense that the human condition is defeat and failure. (“Anthem,” which he attempted during the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I’m Your Man &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;sessions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, would articulate the consolation embedded in his anti-utopian philosophy—“Forget your perfect offering/There is a crack in everything/That’s how the light gets in”—but not for another four years). The fanatic believes he knows exactly what needs to be done. The fanatic can always get out of bed. Obviously, Cohen didn’t endorse any of these ideologies, so he imagined a movement of one, leaving it unclear whether the narrator is an impotent fantasist or a genuine threat. The understanding of the mindset is chilling but, Cohen reasoned, “I’d rather do that with an appetite for extremism than blow up a bus full of schoolchildren.” Zack Snyder, in a rare instance of good taste and humor, deployed it at the end of &lt;i&gt;Watchmen&lt;/i&gt;, where it speaks for the deranged utopianism of Ozymandias.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I’m Your Man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, which Cohen produced himself, has a reputation as Cohen’s synthesizer album, but each lyric demands a different setting. There’s a country song, a Casio blues number, a waltz, a Quiet Storm ballad and whatever the hell “Jazz Police” thinks it is. A friend of mine calls any near-masterpiece flawed by one outright howler a case of “Jazz Police Syndrome” and it’s hard to disagree, even if you accept Cohen’s intention to make “something quite wild and irresponsible,” inspired by hip-hop and the theme of a Pynchonesque “superagency” that secretly controls the world. Frenzied abandon isn’t one of Cohen’s natural modes, especially when it’s expressed through the medium of slap bass and stumbling drum machines. The joke fails to land.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Jazz Police” is the most extreme manifestation of Cohen’s dedication to the sound and the language of “the street.” He made the album in fragments, in Paris, Montreal and Los Angeles, a city that he felt was “really, truly an apocalyptic landscape.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I’m Your Man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is his least spiritual, least poetic, least romantic album. It has no patience for beautiful abstractions. “Ain’t No Cure for Love” (its title inspired by L.A.’s AIDS crisis) and the title track take sentimental clichés—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I’m addicted to love, I’ll do anything for love&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—to brutal extremes. Love is the monkey on his back and he’ll go to any lengths to appease it, even if it means erasing his identity. “I’m Your Man” fades out with Cohen still singing, as if he’s going to keep prostrating himself at the feet of the object of his desire until he gets an answer. There’s a very good chance she’s not listening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cohen leaves the street just once, diverting all of his poetic energies into “Take This Waltz,” his lush version of Lorca’s 1930 poem “Little Viennese Waltz” that first came out in 1986 on the 50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; anniversary of the poet’s death. He said that translating his favorite poet took him 150 hours and a nervous breakdown, which may not be hyperbole because it must have been a mammoth task to honor Lorca’s sinister dreamscape while thoroughly Cohenizing the language. Lorca’s striking image of a forest of dried pigeons becomes “a tree where the doves go to die”; the melancholy hallway becomes “the hallways where love’s never been.” Lorca wrote it during the year he spent in New York, and Cohen’s song retains that dance between the old world and the new as well as the one between love and death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;If you had to boil &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I’m Your Man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;’s worldview down to just two songs, one would be “Everybody Knows,” a grim litany of human cruelty and injustice with a chorus like a Balkan wake. “It pushes things very, very far just to get a laugh,” he said. It’s been serially abused by posturing self-styled mavericks who miss the humor, from Christian Slater’s character in the 1990 teensploitation flick &lt;i&gt;Pump Up the Volume&lt;/i&gt; to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, but that’s not Cohen’s fault. He doesn’t valorize his cynicism or claim that it requires special insight. Everybody knows this stuff deep down, he’s saying. Let’s not kid ourselves. At a press conference in 2013, Cohen was asked by one earnest journalist what he thought about the state of the world. He paused and smiled and said: “Everybody knows.” Of course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The other keystone is “Tower of Song,” which suggests Beckett’s famous line, “I can’t go on; I’ll go on,” reworked as a stand-up comedy routine. “I was born like this/I had no choice/I was born with the gift of a golden voice” is the most famous of a string of very good jokes. Cohen laughed when he wrote that line: “a laugh that comes with the release of truth.” Elsewhere, he holds out the possibility that, despite all we’ve been told, things might not be as bad as he imagined: “There’s a mighty judgement coming but I may be wrong/You see you hear these funny voices/In the Tower of Song.” Even the music is comical, with its rinky-dink keyboard rhythm and faltering one-finger keyboard solo. On his comeback tour it functioned as both light relief and the key to his whole career—he recited the lyric when he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008. Here, its droll resignation steers the album away from futility at the last moment. This is Cohen climbing out of his depression by accepting his lot as a singer and writer—a lifelong resident in the tower he described as a combination of factory and bordello. Songwriting is how he makes himself useful. It’s not much, but perhaps it is enough.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Right up until his death on November 7, at the age of 82, Cohen was a great believer in useful songs. He once told a story about a conversation that helped him summon the conviction to finish the album when he was in a trough of despair. A friend told him that her father, who also suffered from chronic depression, had recently had a dream that made him feel better. It was a dream about Cohen. “I don’t have to worry because Leonard is picking up the stones,” he told her, smiling.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I’m Your Man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; gives the impression that Cohen took this responsibility very seriously. It’s not an uplifting album, but it’s a strangely reassuring one, because you feel that Cohen is working like a dog on the listener’s behalf to make the intolerable tolerable. Leonard is picking up the stones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nominally, &lt;i&gt;The Microcosm&lt;/i&gt; is a European sequel to&lt;i&gt; &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18655-i-am-the-center-private-issue-new-age-music-in-america-1950-1990/"&gt;I Am the Center: Private Issue New Age Music in America, 1950-1990&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, a heavyweight compilation of American new age music curated by Douglas Mcgowan of the California-based Yoga Records and released on Light in the Attic in 2013. But it’s not quite that simple. In ’70s America, cassettes by artists like Steve Halpern and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31452-iasos/"&gt;Iasos&lt;/a&gt; became surprise best sellers, and new age became an industry, with a mail order network, its own chart—even, from 1987 onward, its own Grammy Award. But while this sort of music—mellow, instrumental, technologically savvy and concerned with matters of the spirit—certainly existed in Europe, it defied such easy categorization. In &lt;i&gt;The Microcosm&lt;/i&gt;’s liner notes, McGowan explains how more than one artist featured refused to be involved if the project carried the “new age” tag. Instead, the collection is subtitled&lt;i&gt; Visionary Music Of Continental Europe&lt;/i&gt;, and if that sounds vague, McGowan has set himself the task to prove otherwise, drawing lines between disparate musicians who share a belief in something greater, but are resolutely off on their own trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas &lt;i&gt;I Am the Center&lt;/i&gt; surveyed several generations, covering a 40-year window between 1950 and 1990, &lt;i&gt;The Microcosm&lt;/i&gt; takes a tighter focus. The earliest of these 16 tracks dates from 1970—birth year of pioneering commercial synths like the ARP 2500 and Minimoog—and the latest from 1986, as analog instruments were being superseded by a new generation of digital music equipment. Some names here will be familiar to those even loosely acquainted with experimental European music of the period. The compilation begins with “Creation Du Monde,” a 1973 track by &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5612-vangelis/"&gt;Vangelis&lt;/a&gt;, who would later find global fame scoring &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/"&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Chariots of Fire&lt;/i&gt;, but is featured here having just left the Greek prog rock group Aphrodite’s Child to explore more ambient realms. A serene soundscape made from a Hammond organ treated with tape echo, it found its way to soundtrack Carl Sagan’s &lt;i&gt;Cosmos&lt;/i&gt;, and thus to the ears of a generation of American youth open to enlightenment from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also present are a number of names typically associated with krautrock—itself a term contested by its creators, but that’s another story. &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/8800-hans-joachim-roedelius/"&gt;Hans-Joachim Roedelius&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29862-kluster/"&gt;Kluster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/8797-harmonia/"&gt;Harmonia&lt;/a&gt;, is represented by “Wenn Der Südwind Weht,” which sends a blissfully centered melody pirouetting slowly through a soft cumulonimbus of synths. “Brüder Des Schattens—Söhne des Lichts” captures &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5820-popol-vuh/"&gt;Popol Vuh&lt;/a&gt; some years after founder &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/24251-florian-fricke/"&gt;Florian Fricke&lt;/a&gt; had abandoned synthesizers as a route to transcendence; instead we hear them crafting a medieval-tinged devotional music with sitar, piano and church choir. &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5842-manuel-gottsching/"&gt;Manuel Göttsching&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/144-ash-ra-tempel/"&gt;Ash Ra Tempel&lt;/a&gt; were, early on, one of the more fiery and eruptive kraut groups, but “Le Sourire Volé” is in line with the looping experiments of Göttsching’s solo work, guitar and Farfisa organ cast out in shimmering waves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All great stuff, but even when pursuing spiritual ends, the krautrock groups veer towards studious art music, and the most intriguing material on &lt;i&gt;The Microcosm&lt;/i&gt; comes from its more obscure, eccentric figures—a cast of mystics, shamans and oddballs who, in their friendly earnestness and paperback spirituality, feel somewhat closer to the American new age fraternity. Some, like Robert Julian Horky or &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32617-ariel-kalma/"&gt;Ariel Kalma&lt;/a&gt;, achieve rich soundscapes through homespun means: the former, a longhaired Austrian flautist, achieved his remarkable, pulsating “Dance for a Warrior” by running his instrument through an Eventide Harmonizer; the latter’s “Orguitar Soir” gently layers plucked guitar, droning Farfisa and the sound of birdsong captured in the Borneo rainforest. Others, like Ralph Lundsten or Gigi Masin, pare their music right back, leaving mere wisps of melody and warm tones that glow like embers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mcgowan’s liner notes are an essential accompaniment to this often abstract music, supplying valuable biographical context. Bernard Xolotl, a French-born synesthete and student of sacred geometry, explains his deeply trippy “Cometary Wailing (Night Plateau)” was recorded during a week of “musical transcendence rites” powered by MDMA. Enno Velthuys, whose “Morning Glory” is one of the compilation’s gentle highlights, is described as a “Dutch Syd Barrett,” a ’60s burnout who whiled away his dotage lost in a private world of psychedelic synth exploration. And there is the German-born musician Georg Deuter, whose “Spirales” is plucked from one of his 60 albums of reiki sound healing, made while resident of Rajneeshpuram, a commune in eastern Oregon founded by the Indian guru Osho. (In a dark twist of a very new-age kind, Rajneeshpuram entered the history books when Osho’s followers contaminated salad bars across Oregon with salmonella, poisoning at least 700 people—the largest biological terrorism attack in US history).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, good stories. But &lt;i&gt;The Microcosm&lt;/i&gt; would stand up without them. New age might be a goldmine, but even a quick survey of the genre demonstrates you need to dig through plenty of fluff to find the good material, and it’s a testament to Mcgowan’s research that nothing here feels hokey or kitschy. If this feels like a slightly less coherent set than&lt;i&gt; I Am the Center&lt;/i&gt;, blame the idea of visionary music itself, a category that—by its nature, perhaps—lacks clear boundaries. Still, none of that diminishes the power of the contents. As Robert Julian Horky puts it: “I do my work under any name or label. Time is a River, you know.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Few genres ride the cutting edge as efficiently and boldly as grime. Much like hip-hop, grime’s startlingly adventurous productions have often predicted the shapes and sounds that will bubble up from the underground and into the pop sector. Recent innovations from the likes of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32640-rabit/"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Rabit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31851-logos/"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Logos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/djmurlo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Murlo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31592-visionist/"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Visionist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have stretched grime’s boundaries, nudging the genre into ever more surreal and unexpected directions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;In 2014, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://gobstopper-records.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Gobstopper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; label boss &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32621-mr-mitch/"&gt;Mr. Mitch&lt;/a&gt; and London-based producer Yamaneko further solidified their places among this new wave, &lt;span class="s1"&gt;with the release of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20001-parallel-memories/"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Parallel Memories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/dazedandconfused/sets/yamaneko-pixel-wave-embrace" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pixel Wave Embrace&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Parallel Memories &lt;/i&gt;contained gossamer textures and breathless tracts of negative space. &lt;i&gt;Pixel Wave Embrace&lt;/i&gt; was animated by the idyllic moods and vivid colors of meditation tapes and video game soundtracks. Both pointed to a softer, slower, and sparser approach to a genre infamous for its whiplash juxtapositions and hardline tenacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Over the last year, Mitch and Yamaneko have been working intermittently on a joint project, Yaroze Dream Suite, the results of which are collected in this four-track EP. “There’s a Venn diagram where &lt;i&gt;Parallel Memories &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Pixel Wave Embrace&lt;/i&gt; meet and a lot of this project came from there,” &lt;a href="http://www.passionweiss.com/2016/10/12/yaroze-dream-suite-mr-mitch-yamaneko-interview/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Yamaneko has said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and for the most part that sentiment holds true. Opener “Pixel Dreams” sets the tone for the EP’s woozy, climate-controlled atmosphere. Built around a strikingly simple melody and spacey, shivering synth tones, the track is the most successful marriage of the two producers’ styles: Mitch’s love for cool, weightless minimalism and Yamaneko’s new age-mining ambience. Plinking chirps, video game sound FX, and trap-like snaps lend the song additional heft, but the outcome remains keenly delicate, dulcet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Closer “Spirit Temple” is similarly jaunty—all skeletal beat programming and melodious synths. Like “Pixel Dreams,” it trades grime’s brute force for restraint, as its arrangements unspool slowly. This scenic take on grime allows the listener to zoom in on each component, drawing out subtle threads and small pockets of emotion that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. “In the Moonlight,” featuring guest vocalist Hannah Mack, flutters with ghostly sirens, prodding synths, and a plaintive sax line; when Mack invites us to “Free your mind/‘Cuz everything’s sublime,” it underscores the EP’s central theme. This is grime engineered to float, not punch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Despite the EP’s pillowy silhouettes and beguiling tempos—and several moments of outright bliss—&lt;i&gt;Yaroze Dream Suite &lt;/i&gt;often falls prey to its own moderation. Where the duo’s solo releases come across meditative and understated, &lt;i&gt;YDS &lt;/i&gt;occasionally scans as mild, and, at times, underdone. No where is this more apparent than on “Awakening,” a brooding cut chiseled from rumbling pads and disembodied vocals; it circles itself a half or so dozen times without going anywhere particularly surprising, or novel. The scope of the EP just feels smaller. Still, &lt;i&gt;YDS&lt;/i&gt; remains fascinating throughout, and the question of how its ideas will shape the duo’s future output is enough to strike the interest of any grime diehard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Pretty much every project &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6018-david-pajo/"&gt;David Pajo&lt;/a&gt; has participated in—the pioneering post-rock of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/"&gt;Slint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"&gt;Tortoise&lt;/a&gt;, his winding instrumentals and downbeat folk as &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3247-papa-m/"&gt;Papa M&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3466-pajo/"&gt;Pajo&lt;/a&gt;, the blunt heavy metal of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5732-dead-child/"&gt;Dead Child&lt;/a&gt;—has made a virtue of stylistic consistency. Once you’ve heard the few first notes of a Pajo album, you know what you’re in for, and that commitment to cohesion has always been a strength.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;All of which makes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Highway Songs &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;a risky record. For the first time, Pajo has relaxed his directorial control—“I just would let the songs go on tangents and run wherever they want,” he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://clrvynt.com/david-pajo-interview/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;recently—and mixed styles rather than picking one. He opens with a lumbering metal jam, switches to an &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"&gt;Autechre&lt;/a&gt;-like electronic collage, then shifts to soundtrack-worthy guitar accompanied by a sharp drum-machine beat. The rest of the ride on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Highway Songs &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is just as enjoyably bumpy, as contrasting styles continually butt up against each other with little in the way of smoothed-out segues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;What makes it all work is Pajo’s patience in constructing a song. Everything here truly unfolds, gradually moving from an initial idea—a riff, a beat, a simple melody—into a multi-layered composition. You can almost hear him working through the tunes as he’s making them, which gives them an intimate feel. Lots of Pajo’s best music—particularly Papa M’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Whatever, Mortal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and his &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6575-pajo/"&gt;self-titled Pajo LP&lt;/a&gt;—bears this kind of private, homemade aura, enhanced by a voice that’s always on the verge of a whisper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In the case of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Highway Songs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, the music is &lt;i&gt;literally&lt;/i&gt; homemade, recorded while Pajo was cooped up in his Los Angeles apartment recovering from a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BCx2FWik_gd/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;motorcycle accident&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; that almost cost him a leg. It’s been a rough past few years for him: in early 2015 he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/david-pajo-talks-suicide-attempt-recovery-in-new-interview-20150318" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;attempted suicide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, which he’s been forthcoming about since. You can hear some of that pain and struggle in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Highway Songs—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;take the somber, cautious strains of the acoustic guitar essay “DLVD”—but it would be unfair to say this album is more emotional than any of his others. He’s always infused his music with a wistful, poignant tone, and he’s still great at that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Besides, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Highway Songs &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;ultimately feels hopeful rather than weary, upbeat rather than defeated. There’s optimism in the sunny strums of “Walking On Coronado,” the chugging riffs of “Green Holler,” and the nursery rhyme of closer “Little Girl,” the only song on which Pajo sings. The lyrics are taken from a songbook Pajo found, but they could’ve easily been custom-written for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Highway Songs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;: “Little girl,  teach me to laugh again...to wonder why again.” At this point in his well-travelled career Pajo doesn’t need to learn anything new, but it’s great to hear that he still wants to anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Over the past four years, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31259-tinashe/"&gt;Tinashe&lt;/a&gt;, a 23-year-old &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnTxsTs_SjY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;former child actor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; turned singer, has been nudging the needle of R&amp;amp;B forward with a handful of moody and distinctive projects. Eschewing the glossy production and gospel-influenced, showboating singing style characteristic of traditional R&amp;amp;B, she wove a cocoon, leaning on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgGsMhL9I98" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;woozy, atmospheric beats that nodded to chopped-n-screwed culture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. Despite her movie-biz background and, yes, camera-ready face, however, she’s struggled to break through in the music industry. In an interview with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://xonecole.com/blurred-lines-tinashe-on-the-limitations-colorism-places-on-black-womens-success/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;xoNecole&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; last year, Tinashe explained why she hadn’t been given much support.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“I think it comes from a place of there is only room for one. Or there is only room for two. … There is a &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"&gt;Beyoncé&lt;/a&gt;, there is a &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"&gt;Rihanna&lt;/a&gt;, there is Zendaya, there is a Jourdan Dunn. There is a Black girl in all of these positions and we don’t need another one. It’s just kind of ridiculous because there are like a hundred blonde, white actresses and leading ladies. There are a hundred rappers that all virtually look the same, sound the same, and dress the same and no one cares. But for some reason, when it comes to young women … There can’t be room [for us all]. There can’t be five Black girls winning.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There is truth to her response, especially in rap. As more and more promising female rappers pop up, from an industry standpoint there’s still &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"&gt;Nicki Minaj&lt;/a&gt; and everyone else. &lt;/span&gt;But Tinashe’s music also has a somewhat reticent, inaccessible air to it, and her lyrics lack stickiness, which make holding the spotlight hard.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Despite her best efforts—the choreographed shows, the sexy cover shoots, the collabs with bigger players like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=185&amp;amp;v=IltwiyqKhEI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Chris Brown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mHO_oFqQ4o" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nick Jonas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—and a warm critical reception (&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19910-tinashe-aquarius/"&gt;Aquarius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;her 2014 debut studio album, ranked on many year-end lists, including Pitchfork’s)—she hasn’t quite become a “star.” She scored a mainstream smash with 2014’s “2 On,” but that might have been a fluke, owing more to the ubiquity of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32441-dj-mustard/"&gt;DJ Mustard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;’s club-ready beats and a stronger POV than Tinashe typically employs in her&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; own slippery vision. Clearly, her team wants Tinashe to be a radio artist (see her addition on a new version of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6916-britney-spears/"&gt;Britney&lt;/a&gt;’s sharp “Slumber Party”), but she is making much smarter music than “2 On” or “All Hands on Deck.” In fact, if claiming a spot on heavy rotation playlists is the goal, she might be making music that’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;too&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; good, as evinced by her latest project, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nightride&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Delays of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Joyride,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; her upcoming sophomore album, and fuzziness over exactly what &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nightride&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is—a mixtape for sale, a companion piece to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Joyride&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;hint to her team’s confusion of how to market the excellent yet not-easily-defined music she’s creating. For example, “Energy,” the mystical &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31333-mike-will-made-it/"&gt;Mike WiLL Made-It&lt;/a&gt; track, is one of the best songs of the year and it didn’t even make the cut here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Album opener “Lucid Dreaming” is a soothing balm, its wooden chimes evoking the calm of savasana. However, &lt;i&gt;Nightride&lt;/i&gt;’s first half is heavily weighted with somber ballads, and the first 25 minutes begin to drag, with the exception of the taut “Company,” which skitters and flits. But from that point on, &lt;i&gt;Nightride&lt;/i&gt; sounds fascinating and, while polished, less sleek and cold than the title suggests. It has more of an ominous, broken-down carnival vibe. Tinashe is making some very weird music here (she’s not alone in that, of course—Sevyn Streeter, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30349-dawn-richard/"&gt;Dawn Richard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/33036-abra/"&gt;Abra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31712-kelela/"&gt;Kelela&lt;/a&gt; immediately spring to mind as her peers). The lopsided, one-wheel-falling-off wonk of “&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17961-tinashe-ride-of-your-life/"&gt;Ride of Your Life&lt;/a&gt;” gives way to “Party Favors,” an off-kilter banger that inflates and deflates, swelling with and hissing out helium. And really, considering the country is currently on Mr. Trump’s Wild Ride, shouldn’t the music crafted during it swerve left, taking bumpy, pitch-black back roads instead of paved, well-lit streets?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Generally, production here is drizzly and overcast, and work from newcomer Stephen Spencer (his glitchy-yet-sultry slow-burner “Spacetime” is just begging to soundtrack a futuristic sex scene) to vets like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32198-metro-boomin/"&gt;Metro Boomin&lt;/a&gt;, Boi-1da, and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"&gt;The-Dream&lt;/a&gt; (whose winking “Company” is the lone cloudless song on the project) is excellent and cohesive despite there being almost as many producers as there are songs. Obviously they were inspired by the theme—Tinashe has long preferred shadows and slinkiness to bright poppiness, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nightride&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is strictly after-hours music. She even trades her standard breathiness for a richer tone to match the deep groove of “Sunburn.” The listener’s only decision is setting—dim club, deserted freeway, darkened bedroom. The music is infinitely interesting, possibly more so than the artist singing it. But then again, you shouldn’t count out anyone releasing an album like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nightride&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. As she whispers after “Sacrifices,” “I will not be ignored.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Odd Entrances&lt;/i&gt; arrived fast, even by &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"&gt;Thee Oh Sees&lt;/a&gt; standards. The Bay Area-born psych band has always worked at a feverish clip—at least an album a year, in additions to shelves of singles, EPs, rarities and miscellany—but their 18th and latest studio full-length follows its predecessor &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22185-a-weird-exits/"&gt;A Weird Exits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; by a mere three months (for the truly impatient fan, they’d also released a live album just a month before that one). The band has reached the point where their prolificacy has become a kind of performance art, an experiment in how much worthwhile product one group can deliver without releasing an outright dud. Though it’s not a force of nature like the other LPs Thee Oh Sees have produced since returning from their farcically brief 2013 hiatus, &lt;i&gt;Odd Entrances&lt;/i&gt; more than keeps their streak alive.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Making the most of the band’s new, double-drummer lineup, &lt;i&gt;A Weird Exits&lt;/i&gt; was a concussive dropkick of a record, as focused and ruthlessly efficient as a wood chipper. It didn’t even pause for any of the woozy, psych-pop numbers that frontman John Dwyer usually smuggles onto each record, and now we know why: He was saving them for this one. Recorded during the same sessions, &lt;i&gt;An Odd Entrances&lt;/i&gt; is a kinder, gentler companion to its shredding predecessor (“an appendix, if you will,” according to the liner notes), a clearinghouse for all the tangents and detours that would have dulled that record’s fierceness. It’s got riffs—opener “You Will Find It Here” is an absolute beast—but for the most part &lt;i&gt;Entrances&lt;/i&gt; doesn’t try to melt your face. It just wants to hang out a bit, maybe split a joint and stare at the sky before calling it an early night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Three of these six songs are leisurely instrumentals, one of them, “Jammed Exit,” a direct continuation of &lt;i&gt;Exits&lt;/i&gt;’ trippiest number, “Jammed Entrance.” The tracks share the same Krautrock groove, except this time a wayward flute scribbles all over it. Like much of &lt;i&gt;Entrances&lt;/i&gt;, it feels like a record collector’s in joke—a nod, perhaps, to the Blues Project’s &lt;i&gt;Projections&lt;/i&gt;, or maybe some forgotten &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13532-where-the-action-is-los-angeles-nuggets-1965-1968/"&gt;Nuggets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;-era deep cut. Other references are less obscure. “The Poem” is pure &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13436-magical-mystery-tour/"&gt;Magical Mystery Tour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, right down its spacey prose and melted-taffy strings, while “At the End, on the Stairs” conjures a &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1131-donovan/"&gt;Donovan&lt;/a&gt;-esque blur of paisley and incense. Then “Nervous Tech (Nah John)” ends the record as it began, with another percolating jam that lets both of the drummers get some.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Much to the exasperation of newcomers looking for a consensus entry point into their endless discography, Thee Oh Sees have been so astonishingly consistent that few of their records tower far above (or for that matter fall far below) any other. &lt;i&gt;An Odd Entrances&lt;/i&gt; is the rare effort from the band that clearly announces itself as a lesser work. Even at just half an hour long, it’s so disconnected that it feels more like an odds-and-ends collection than the group’s actual odds and ends compilations. Casual fans can take a guilt-free pass on this one, then, but as always, the group’s insatiable base won’t have any reason to regret placing their pre-orders. If &lt;i&gt;A Weird Exits&lt;/i&gt; was Thee Oh Sees’ Thanksgiving feast, &lt;i&gt;An Odd Entrances&lt;/i&gt; is Friday’s turkey and stuffing sandwich—hardly a destination meal, but plenty satisfying in its own way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;All the world’s a stage to Elias Bender Rønnenfelt, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29540-iceage/"&gt;Iceage&lt;/a&gt; frontman and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30766-marching-church/"&gt;Marching Church&lt;/a&gt; mastermind. The Dane was sporting a death mask when we first met him in the early ’10s—a grungy Hamlet, flailing and wailing beneath the house lights. Championed by Matador, his band ascended, and in time, those tragic poses became more polished, less garish—and on 2014’s ambitious &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19806-iceage-plowing-into-the-field-of-love/"&gt;Plowing Into the Field of Love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, downright romantic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Rønnenfelt attempted to continue Iceage’s momentum after their last album&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, but his writing failed to open up a clear map for the band’s next steps. Naturally, the musician wrung out his brainstorms into the new Marching Church album instead. This time around, the project’s no longer a solo effort: Rønnenfelt’s formally incorporated his backing band from &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20436-this-world-is-not-enough/"&gt;This World Is Not Enough&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;–a formidable crew featuring members of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30458-lower/"&gt;Lower&lt;/a&gt;, Hand of Dust, and others—and his Iceage bandmate Johan S. Weith into the group writ large. Such moves beg the question of overarching intentions, of where Iceage ends and Marching Church begins; despite the confessional undertones of its title, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Telling It Like It Is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;offers little in the way of demarcation–but boy, is there drama.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Last year, the Dane &lt;a href="https://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/products/sbr126-marching-church-this-world-is-not-enough" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;visualized&lt;/a&gt; his Marching Church as one man’s luxuriant fantasy, plucked from the pages of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Dorian Gray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; (“What I pictured was me in a comfortable armchair, adorned in a golden robe, leading a band while a girl kept pouring me champagne”). This decadence—manifested in moaned tantrums, eye-rolling Swans worship, and directionless, woe-is-me racket—torpedoed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This World Is Not Enough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, rendering it a slog. Thankfully, Marching Church’s sophomore effort scales back the melodrama and ramps up the discipline: Rønnenfelt and company are focused on verses and choruses and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;dynamics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, rather than self-indulgent noodling—and in the case of this album, a little bit goes a long way. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The delirious “&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18531-marching-church-lions-den/"&gt;Lion’s Den&lt;/a&gt;” opens with a far-off subterranean rumble—Kristian Emdal’s loping bass encircles a skittering piano line, while the forlorn melodica squeals–before a brittle, clanging backbeat surfaces, kicking off the hypnotic death march over which Rønnenfelt presides, eyes glinting, lips curled. After he’s lulled us into complacency with an otherworldly falsetto, the chorus hits, his voice deepens into his usual bloodthirsty moan, and dread sets in. “In t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;he lion’s den,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;” he taunts, as if smelling our fear through the speakers, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;They still bite after you/They still chase after you/Come on in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;” Is Rønnenfelt offering an escape from the beasts’ assault, or is he just another big cat  in the big city, peering from behind his disguise? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The beauty’s in the liminality: not just on “Lion’s Den,” but in the album’s broader creative approach, which, however formalistically grounded, seeks to blur the lines between human passion and studio precision through copious overdubbing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. “We wanted it to sound like a studio and the instruments, as if the studio became a member of the band,” he told CLRVYNT, “We didn't want it to sound like a realistic live band playing.” Indeed, the album’s inherent connections with the uncanny valley, its inquiries into where the band ends and the cavernous surroundings begin, are more effective dramatic vessels than any of Rønnenfelt’s ham-fisted imagery. It’s hard not to stifle a chuckle at his operatic bellows regarding the act of being “fist-fucked by destiny,” or at the blistering chorus on “Heart of Life,” wherein the Dane offers a compelling impression of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/710-nick-cave/"&gt;Nick Cave&lt;/a&gt; after a few too many cocktails—“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;At the heart of life, shoo-gahh!.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;On the other hand, the record's overarching dynamics—the existential tug-of-war between the band’s hypnotic krautrock attack, Rønnenfelt’s vengeful yowls, and the studio’s limitless expanses on the glam-but-glum “2016” and the country-tinged “Calenture” (familiar and yet ever-so-off, like a trip to Westworld)–suggest that the musician’s at least partially aware of his own absurdity, and perhaps, that he’s learning how to weaponize it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
